There are nearer\napproaches to modern metaphysics in the Philebus and in the Sophist;\nthe Politicus or Statesman is more ideal; the form and institutions\nof the State are more clearly drawn out in the Laws; as works of art,\nthe Symposium and the Protagoras are of higher excellence. But no\nother Dialogue of Plato has the same largeness of view and the same\nperfection of style; no other shows an equal knowledge of the world,\nor contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old, and\nnot of one age only but of all. Nowhere in Plato is there a deeper\nirony or a greater wealth of humor or imagery, or more dramatic power.\nNor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave\nlife and speculation, or to connect politics with philosophy. The\nRepublic is the centre around which the other Dialogues may be grouped;\nhere philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancient thinkers\never attained. Plato among the Greeks, like Bacon among the moderns,\nwas the first who conceived a method of knowledge, although neither\nof them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance\nof truth; and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of\nscience which was not yet realized. He was the greatest metaphysical\ngenius whom the world has seen; and in him, more than in any other\nancient thinker, the germs of future knowledge are contained. The\nsciences of logic and psychology, which have supplied so many instruments\nof thought to after-ages, are based upon the analyses of Socrates\nand Plato. The principles of definition, the law of contradiction,\nthe fallacy of arguing in a circle, the distinction between the essence\nand accidents of a thing or notion, between means and ends, between\ncauses and conditions; also the division of the mind into the rational,\nconcupiscent, and irascible elements, or of pleasures and desires\ninto necessary and unnecessary --these and other great forms of thought\nare all of them to be found in the Republic, and were probably first\ninvented by Plato. The greatest of all logical truths, and the one\nof which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight, the difference\nbetween words and things, has been most strenuously insisted on by\nhim, although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his\nown writings. But he does not bind up truth in logical formulae, --logic\nis still veiled in metaphysics; and the science which he imagines\nto \"contemplate all truth and all existence\" is very unlike the doctrine\nof the syllogism which Aristotle claims to have discovered.\n\nNeither must we forget that the Republic is but the third part of\na still larger design which was to have included an ideal history\nof Athens, as well as a political and physical philosophy. The fragment\nof the Critias has given birth to a world-famous fiction, second only\nin importance to the tale of Troy and the legend of Arthur; and is\nsaid as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the\nsixteenth century. This mythical tale, of which the subject was a\nhistory of the wars of the Athenians against the Island of Atlantis,\nis supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of Solon, to which\nit would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the logographers\nto the poems of Homer. It would have told of a struggle for Liberty,\nintended to represent the conflict of Persia and Hellas. We may judge\nfrom the noble commencement of the Timaeus, from the fragment of the\nCritias itself, and from the third book of the Laws, in what manner\nPlato would have treated this high argument. We can only guess why\nthe great design was abandoned; perhaps because Plato became sensible\nof some incongruity in a fictitious history, or because he had lost\nhis interest in it, or because advancing years forbade the completion\nof it; and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary\nnarrative ever been finished, we should have found Plato himself sympathizing\nwith the struggle for Hellenic independence, singing a hymn of triumph\nover Marathon and Salamis, perhaps making the reflection of Herodotus\nwhere he contemplates the growth of the Athenian empire--\"How brave\na thing is freedom of speech, which has made the Athenians so far\nexceed every other state of Hellas in greatness!\" or, more probably,\nattributing the victory to the ancient good order of Athens and to\nthe favor of Apollo and Athene. \n\nAgain, Plato may be regarded as the \"captain\" ('arhchegoz') or leader\nof a goodly band of followers; for in the Republic is to be found\nthe original of Cicero's De Republica, of St. Augustine's City of\nGod, of the Utopia of Sir Thomas More, and of the numerous other imaginary\nStates which are framed upon the same model. The extent to which Aristotle\nor the Aristotelian school were indebted to him in the Politics has\nbeen little recognized, and the recognition is the more necessary\nbecause it is not made by Aristotle himself. The two philosophers\nhad more in common than they were conscious of; and probably some\nelements of Plato remain still undetected in Aristotle. In English\nphilosophy too, many affinities may be traced, not only in the works\nof the Cambridge Platonists, but in great original writers like Berkeley\nor Coleridge, to Plato and his ideas. That there is a truth higher\nthan experience, of which the mind bears witness to herself, is a\nconviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically asserted,\nand is perhaps gaining ground. Of the Greek authors who at the Renaissance\nbrought a new life into the world Plato has had the greatest influence.\nThe Republic of Plato is also the first treatise upon education, of\nwhich the writings of Milton and Locke, Rousseau, Jean Paul, and Goethe\nare the legitimate descendants. Like Dante or Bunyan, he has a revelation\nof another life; like Bacon, he is profoundly impressed with the un\nunity of knowledge; in the early Church he exercised a real influence\non theology, and at the Revival of Literature on politics. Even the\nfragments of his words when \"repeated at second-hand\" have in all\nages ravished the hearts of men, who have seen reflected in them their\nown higher nature. He is the father of idealism in philosophy, in\npolitics, in literature. And many of the latest conceptions of modern\nthinkers and statesmen, such as the unity of knowledge, the reign\nof law, and the equality of the sexes, have been anticipated in a\ndream by him. \n\nArgument \n\nThe argument of the Republic is the search after Justice, the nature\nof which is first hinted at by Cephalus, the just and blameless old\nman --then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by Socrates\nand Polemarchus --then caricatured by Thrasymachus and partially explained\nby Socrates --reduced to an abstraction by Glaucon and Adeimantus,\nand having become invisible in the individual reappears at length\nin the ideal State which is constructed by Socrates. The first care\nof the rulers is to be education, of which an outline is drawn after\nthe old Hellenic model, providing only for an improved religion and\nmorality, and more simplicity in music and gymnastic, a manlier strain\nof poetry, and greater harmony of the individual and the State. We\nare thus led on to the conception of a higher State, in which \"no\nman calls anything his own,\" and in which there is neither \"marrying\nnor giving in marriage,\" and \"kings are philosophers\" and \"philosophers\nare kings;\" and there is another and higher education, intellectual\nas well as moral and religious, of science as well as of art, and\nnot of youth only but of the whole of life. Such a State is hardly\nto be realized in this world and would quickly degenerate. To the\nperfect ideal succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover\nof honor, this again declining into democracy, and democracy into\ntyranny, in an imaginary but regular order having not much resemblance\nto the actual facts. When \"the wheel has come full circle\" we do not\nbegin again with a new period of human life; but we have passed from\nthe best to the worst, and there we end. The subject is then changed\nand the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy which had been more lightly\ntreated in the earlier books of the Republic is now resumed and fought\nout to a conclusion. Poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice\nremoved from the truth, and Homer, as well as the dramatic poets,\nhaving been condemned as an imitator, is sent into banishment along\nwith them. And the idea of the State is supplemented by the revelation\nof a future life. \n\nThe division into books, like all similar divisions, is probably later\nthan the age of Plato. The natural divisions are five in number; --(1)\nBook I and the first half of Book II down to the paragraph beginning,\n\"I had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus,\" which\nis introductory; the first book containing a refutation of the popular\nand sophistical notions of justice, and concluding, like some of the\nearlier Dialogues, without arriving at any definite result. To this\nis appended a restatement of the nature of justice according to common\nopinion, and an answer is demanded to the question --What is justice,\nstripped of appearances? The second division (2) includes the remainder\nof the second and the whole of the third and fourth books, which are\nmainly occupied with the construction of the first State and the first\neducation. The third division (3) consists of the fifth, sixth, and\nseventh books, in which philosophy rather than justice is the subject\nof inquiry, and the second State is constructed on principles of communism\nand ruled by philosophers, and the contemplation of the idea of good\ntakes the place of the social and political virtues. In the eighth\nand ninth books (4) the perversions of States and of the individuals\nwho correspond to them are reviewed in succession; and the nature\nof pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analyzed in the\nindividual man. The tenth book (5) is the conclusion of the whole,\nin which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally determined,\nand the happiness of the citizens in this life, which has now been\nassured, is crowned by the vision of another. \n\nOr a more general division into two parts may be adopted; the first\n(Books I - IV) containing the description of a State framed generally\nin accordance with Hellenic notions of religion and morality, while\nin the second (Books V - X) the Hellenic State is transformed into\nan ideal kingdom of philosophy, of which all other governments are\nthe perversions. These two points of view are really opposed, and\nthe opposition is only veiled by the genius of Plato. The Republic,\nlike the Phaedrus, is an imperfect whole; the higher light of philosophy\nbreaks through the regularity of the Hellenic temple, which at last\nfades away into the heavens. Whether this imperfection of structure\narises from an enlargement of the plan; or from the imperfect reconcilement\nin the writer's own mind of the struggling elements of thought which\nare now first brought together by him; or, perhaps, from the composition\nof the work at different times --are questions, like the similar question\nabout the Iliad and the Odyssey, which are worth asking, but which\ncannot have a distinct answer. In the age of Plato there was no regular\nmode of publication, and an author would have the less scruple in\naltering or adding to a work which was known only to a few of his\nfriends. There is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid\nhis labors aside for a time, or turned from one work to another; and\nsuch interruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a\nlong than of a short writing. In all attempts to determine the chronological\nhe order of the Platonic writings on internal evidence, this uncertainty\nabout any single Dialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing\nelement, which must be admitted to affect longer works, such as the\nRepublic and the Laws, more than shorter ones. But, on the other hand,\nthe seeming discrepancies of the Republic may only arise out of the\ndiscordant elements which the philosopher has attempted to unite in\na single whole, perhaps without being himself able to recognize the\ninconsistency which is obvious to us. For there is a judgment of after\nages which few great writers have ever been able to anticipate for\nthemselves. They do not perceive the want of connection in their own\nwritings, or the gaps in their systems which are visible enough to\nthose who come after them. In the beginnings of literature and philosophy,\namid the first efforts of thought and language, more inconsistencies\noccur than now, when the paths of speculation are well worn and the\nmeaning of words precisely defined. For consistency, too, is the growth\nof time; and some of the greatest creations of the human mind have\nbeen wanting in unity. Tried by this test, several of the Platonic\nDialogues, according to our modern ideas, appear to be defective,\nbut the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at different\ntimes or by different hands. And the supposition that the Republic\nwas written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some\ndegree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of the work\nto another. \n\nThe second title, \"Concerning Justice,\" is not the one by which the\nRepublic is quoted, either by Aristotle or generally in antiquity,\nand, like the other second titles of the Platonic Dialogues, may therefore\nbe assumed to be of later date. Morgenstern and others have asked\nwhether the definition of justice, which is the professed aim, or\nthe construction of the State is the principal argument of the work.\nThe answer is, that the two blend in one, and are two faces of the\nsame truth; for justice is the order of the State, and the State is\nthe visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society.\nThe one is the soul and the other is the body, and the Greek ideal\nof the State, as of the individual, is a fair mind in a fair body.\nIn Hegelian phraseology the State is the reality of which justice\nis the ideal. Or, described in Christian language, the kingdom of\nGod is within, and yet develops into a Church or external kingdom;\n\"the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\" is reduced\nto the proportions of an earthly building. Or, to use a Platonic image,\njustice and the State are the warp and the woof which run through\nthe whole texture. And when the constitution of the State is completed,\nthe conception of justice is not dismissed, but reappears under the\nsame or different names throughout the work, both as the inner law\nof the individual soul, and finally as the principle of rewards and\npunishments in another life. The virtues are based on justice, of\nwhich common honesty in buying and selling is the shadow, and justice\nis based on the idea of good, which is the harmony of the world, and\nis reflected both in the institutions of States and in motions of\nthe heavenly bodies. The Timaeus, which takes up the political rather\nthan the ethical side of the Republic, and is chiefly occupied with\nhypotheses concerning the outward world, yet contains many indications\nthat the same law is supposed to reign over the State, over nature,\nand over man. \n\nToo much, however, has been made of this question both in ancient\nand in modern times. There is a stage of criticism in which all works,\nwhether of nature or of art, are referred to design. Now in ancient\nwritings, and indeed in literature generally, there remains often\na large element which was not comprehended in the original design.\nFor the plan grows under the author's hand; new thoughts occur to\nhim in the act of writing; he has not worked out the argument to the\nend before he begins. The reader who seeks to find some one idea under\nwhich the whole may be conceived, must necessarily seize on the vaguest\nand most general. Thus Stallbaum, who is dissatisfied with the ordinary\nexplanations of the argument of the Republic, imagines himself to\nhave found the true argument \"in the representation of human life\nin a State perfected by justice and governed according to the idea\nof good.\" There may be some use in such general descriptions, but\nthey can hardly be said to express the design of the writer. The truth\nis, that we may as well speak of many designs as of one; nor need\nanything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which the mind\nis naturally led by the association of ideas, and which does not interfere\nwith the general purpose. What kind or degree of unity is to be sought\nafter in a building, in the plastic arts, in poetry, in prose, is\na problem which has to be determined relatively to the subject-matter.\nTo Plato himself, the inquiry \"what was the intention of the writer,\"\nor \"what was the principal argument of the Republic\" would have been\nhardly intelligible, and therefore had better be at once dismissed.\n\nIs not the Republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which,\nto Plato's own mind, are most naturally represented in the form of\nthe State? Just as in the Jewish prophets the reign of Messiah, or\n\"the day of the Lord,\" or the suffering Servant or people of God,\nor the \"Sun of righteousness with healing in his wings\" only convey,\nto us at least, their great spiritual ideals, so through the Greek\nState Plato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection,\nwhich is the idea of good --like the sun in the visible world; --about\nhuman perfection, which is justice --about education beginning in\nyouth and continuing in later years --about poets and sophists and\ntyrants who are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind --about\n\"the world\" which is the embodiment of them --about a kingdom which\nexists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the pattern\nand rule of human life. No such inspired creation is at unity with\nitself, any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun pierces through\nthem. Every shade of light and dark, of truth, and of fiction which\nis the veil of truth, is allowable in a work of philosophical imagination.\nIt is not all on the same plane; it easily passes from ideas to myths\nand fancies, from facts to figures of speech. It is not prose but\npoetry, at least a great part of it, and ought not to be judged by\nthe rules of logic or the probabilities of history. The writer is\nnot fashioning his ideas into an artistic whole; they take possession\nof him and are too much for him. We have no need therefore to discuss\nwhether a State such as Plato has conceived is practicable or not,\nor whether the outward form or the inward life came first into the\nmind of the writer. For the practicability of his ideas has nothing\nto do with their truth; and the highest thoughts to which he attains\nmay be truly said to bear the greatest \"marks of design\" --justice\nmore than the external frame-work of the State, the idea of good more\nthan justice. The great science of dialectic or the organization of\nideas has no real content; but is only a type of the method or spirit\nin which the higher knowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of\nall time and all existence. It is in the fifth, sixth, and seventh\nbooks that Plato reaches the \"summit of speculation,\" and these, although\nthey fail to satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker, may therefore\nbe regarded as the most important, as they are also the most original,\nportions of the work. \n\nIt is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has\nbeen raised by Boeckh, respecting the imaginary date at which the\nconversation was held (the year 411 B. C. which is proposed by him\nwill do as well as any other); for a writer of fiction, and especially\na writer who, like Plato, is notoriously careless of chronology, only\naims at general probability. Whether all the persons mentioned in\nthe Republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficulty\nwhich would have occurred to an Athenian reading the work forty years\nlater, or to Plato himself at the time of writing (any more than to\nShakespeare respecting one of his own dramas); and need not greatly\ntrouble us now. Yet this may be a question having no answer \"which\nis still worth asking,\" because the investigation shows that we can\nnot argue historically from the dates in Plato; it would be useless\ntherefore to waste time in inventing far-fetched reconcilements of\nthem in order avoid chronological difficulties, such, for example,\nas the conjecture of C. F. Hermann, that Glaucon and Adeimantus are\nnot the brothers but the uncles of Plato, or the fancy of Stallbaum\nthat Plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at\nwhich some of his Dialogues were written. \n\nCharacters \n\nThe principal characters in the Republic are Cephalus, Polemarchus,\nThrasymachus, Socrates, Glaucon, and Adeimantus. Cephalus appears\nin the introduction only, Polemarchus drops at the end of the first\nargument, and Thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the\nfirst book. The main discussion is carried on by Socrates, Glaucon,\nand Adeimantus. Among the company are Lysias (the orator) and Euthydemus,\nthe sons of Cephalus and brothers of Polemarchus, an unknown Charmantides\n--these are mute auditors; also there is Cleitophon, who once interrupts,\nwhere, as in the Dialogue which bears his name, he appears as the\nfriend and ally of Thrasymachus. \n\nCephalus, the patriarch of house, has been appropriately engaged in\noffering a sacrifice. He is the pattern of an old man who has almost\ndone with life, and is at peace with himself and with all mankind.\nHe feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below, and seems to\nlinger around the memory of the past. He is eager that Socrates should\ncome to visit him, fond of the poetry of the last generation, happy\nin the consciousness of a well-spent life, glad at having escaped\nfrom the tyranny of youthful lusts. His love of conversation, his\naffection, his indifference to riches, even his garrulity, are interesting\ntraits of character. He is not one of those who have nothing to say,\nbecause their whole mind has been absorbed in making money. Yet he\nacknowledges that riches have the advantage of placing men above the\ntemptation to dishonesty or falsehood. The respectful attention shown\nto him by Socrates, whose love of conversation, no less than the mission\nimposed upon him by the Oracle, leads him to ask questions of all\nmen, young and old alike, should also be noted. Who better suited\nto raise the question of justice than Cephalus, whose life might seem\nto be the expression of it? The moderation with which old age is pictured\nby Cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic,\nnot only of him, but of Greek feeling generally, and contrasts with\nthe exaggeration of Cicero in the De Senectute. The evening of life\nis described by Plato in the most expressive manner, yet with the\nfewest possible touches. As Cicero remarks (Ep. ad Attic. iv. 16),\nthe aged Cephalus would have been out of place in the discussion which\nfollows, and which he could neither have understood nor taken part\nin without a violation of dramatic propriety. \n\nHis \"son and heir\" Polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness\nof youth; he is for detaining Socrates by force in the opening scene,\nand will not \"let him off\" on the subject of women and children. Like\nCephalus, he is limited in his point of view, and represents the proverbial\nstage of morality which has rules of life rather than principles;\nand he quotes Simonides as his father had quoted Pindar. But after\nthis he has no more to say; the answers which he makes are only elicited\nfrom him by the dialectic of Socrates. He has not yet experienced\nthe influence of the Sophists like Glaucon and Adeimantus, nor is\nhe sensible of the necessity of refuting them; he belongs to the pre-Socratic\nor pre-dialectical age. He is incapable of arguing, and is bewildered\nby Socrates to such a degree that he does not know what he is saying.\nHe is made to admit that justice is a thief, and that the virtues\nfollow the analogy of the arts. From his brother Lysias we learn that\nhe fell a victim to the Thirty Tyrants, but no allusion is here made\nto his fate, nor to the circumstance that Cephalus and his family\nwere of Syracusan origin, and had migrated from Thurii to Athens.\n\nThe \"Chalcedonian giant,\" Thrasymachus, of whom we have already heard\nin the Phaedrus, is the personification of the Sophists, according\nto Plato's conception of them, in some of their worst characteristics.\nHe is vain and blustering, refusing to discourse unless he is paid,\nfond of making an oration, and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable\nSocrates; but a mere child in argument, and unable to foresee that\nthe next \"move\" (to use a Platonic expression) will \"shut him up.\"\nHe has reached the stage of framing general notions, and in this respect\nis in advance of Cephalus and Polemarchus. But he is incapable of\ndefending them in a discussion, and vainly tries to cover his confusion\nin banter and insolence. Whether such doctrines as are attributed\nto him by Plato were really held either by him or by any other Sophist\nis uncertain; in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality\nmight easily grow up --they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers\nin Thucydides; but we are concerned at present with Plato's description\nof him, and not with the historical reality. The inequality of the\ncontest adds greatly to the humor of the scene. The pompous and empty\nSophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great master of dialectic,\nwho knows how to touch all the springs of vanity and weakness in him.\nHe is greatly irritated by the irony of Socrates, but his noisy and\nimbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the thrusts of his\nassailant. His determination to cram down their throats, or put \"bodily\ninto their souls\" his own words, elicits a cry of horror from Socrates.\nThe state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as the process\nof the argument. Nothing is more amusing than his complete submission\nwhen he has been once thoroughly beaten. At first he seems to continue\nthe discussion with reluctance, but soon with apparent good-will,\nand he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one or two\noccasional remarks. When attacked by Glaucon he is humorously protected\nby Socrates \"as one who has never been his enemy and is now his friend.\"\nFrom Cicero and Quintilian and from Aristotle's Rhetoric we learn\nthat the Sophist whom Plato has made so ridiculous was a man of note\nwhose writings were preserved in later ages. The play on his name\nwhich was made by his contemporary Herodicus, \"thou wast ever bold\nin battle,\" seems to show that the description of him is not devoid\nof verisimilitude. \n\nWhen Thrasymachus has been silenced, the two principal respondents,\nGlaucon and Adeimantus, appear on the scene: here, as in Greek tragedy,\nthree actors are introduced. At first sight the two sons of Ariston\nmay seem to wear a family likeness, like the two friends Simmias and\nCebes in the Phaedo. But on a nearer examination of them the similarity\nvanishes, and they are seen to be distinct characters. Glaucon is\nthe impetuous youth who can \"just never have enough of fechting\" (cf.\nthe character of him in Xen. Mem. iii. 6); the man of pleasure who\nis acquainted with the mysteries of love; the \"juvenis qui gaudet\ncanibus,\" and who improves the breed of animals; the lover of art\nand music who has all the experiences of youthful life. He is full\nof quickness and penetration, piercing easily below the clumsy platitudes\nof Thrasymachus to the real difficulty; he turns out to the light\nthe seamy side of human life, and yet does not lose faith in the just\nand true. It is Glaucon who seizes what may be termed the ludicrous\nrelation of the philosopher to the world, to whom a state of simplicity\nis \"a city of pigs,\" who is always prepared with a jest when the argument\noffers him an opportunity, and who is ever ready to second the humor\nof Socrates and to appreciate the ridiculous, whether in the connoisseurs\nof music, or in the lovers of theatricals, or in the fantastic behavior\nof the citizens of democracy. His weaknesses are several times alluded\nto by Socrates, who, however, will not allow him to be attacked by\nhis brother Adeimantus. He is a soldier, and, like Adeimantus, has\nbeen distinguished at the battle of Megara. \n\nThe character of Adeimantus is deeper and graver, and the profounder\nobjections are commonly put into his mouth. Glaucon is more demonstrative,\nand generally opens the game. Adeimantus pursues the argument further.\nGlaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth; Adeimantus\nhas the maturer judgment of a grown-up man of the world. In the second\nbook, when Glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall be considered\nwithout regard to their consequences, Adeimantus remarks that they\nare regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their consequences;\nand in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the\nfourth book that Socrates falls in making his citizens happy, and\nis answered that happiness is not the first but the second thing,\nnot the direct aim but the indirect consequence of the good government\nof a State. In the discussion about religion and mythology, Adeimantus\nis the respondent, but Glaucon breaks in with a slight jest, and carries\non the conversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to\nthe end of the book. It is Adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism\nof common sense on the Socratic method of argument, and who refuses\nto let Socrates pass lightly over the question of women and children.\nIt is Adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative,\nas Glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of the Dialogue.\nFor example, throughout the greater part of the sixth book, the causes\nof the corruption of philosophy and the conception of the idea of\ngood are discussed with Adeimantus. Then Glaucon resumes his place\nof principal respondent; but he has a difficulty in apprehending the\nhigher education of Socrates, and makes some false hits in the course\nof the discussion. Once more Adeimantus returns with the allusion\nto his brother Glaucon whom he compares to the contentious State;\nin the next book he is again superseded, and Glaucon continues to\nthe end. \n\nThus in a succession of characters Plato represents the successive\nstages of morality, beginning with the Athenian gentleman of the olden\ntime, who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating\nhis life by proverbs and saws; to him succeeds the wild generalization\nof the Sophists, and lastly come the young disciples of the great\nteacher, who know the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced\nby them, and desire to go deeper into the nature of things. These\ntoo, like Cephalus, Polemarchus, Thrasymachus, are clearly distinguished\nfrom one another. Neither in the Republic, nor in any other Dialogue\nof Plato, is a single character repeated. \n\nThe delineation of Socrates in the Republic is not wholly consistent.\nIn the first book we have more of the real Socrates, such as he is\ndepicted in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, in the earliest Dialogues\nof Plato, and in the Apology. He is ironical, provoking, questioning,\nthe old enemy of the Sophists, ready to put on the mask of Silenus\nas well as to argue seriously. But in the sixth book his enmity towards\nthe Sophists abates; he acknowledges that they are the representatives\nrather than the corrupters of the world. He also becomes more dogmatic\nand constructive, passing beyond the range either of the political\nor the speculative ideas of the real Socrates. In one passage Plato\nhimself seems to intimate that the time had now come for Socrates,\nwho had passed his whole life in philosophy, to give his own opinion\nand not to be always repeating the notions of other men. There is\nno evidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect\nState were comprehended in the Socratic teaching, though he certainly\ndwelt on the nature of the universal and of final causes (cp. Xen.\nMem. i. 4; Phaedo 97); and a deep thinker like him in his thirty or\nforty years of public teaching, could hardly have falled to touch\non the nature of family relations, for which there is also some positive\nevidence in the Memorabilia (Mem. i. 2, 51 foll.) The Socratic method\nis nominally retained; and every inference is either put into the\nmouth of the respondent or represented as the common discovery of\nhim and Socrates. But any one can see that this is a mere form, of\nwhich the affectation grows wearisome as the work advances. The method\nof inquiry has passed into a method of teaching in which by the help\nof interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various points\nof view. \n\nThe nature of the process is truly characterized by Glaucon, when\nhe describes himself as a companion who is not good for much in an\ninvestigation, but can see what he is shown, and may, perhaps, give\nthe answer to a question more fluently than another. \n\nNeither can we be absolutely certain that, Socrates himself taught\nthe immortality of the soul, which is unknown to his disciple Glaucon\nin the Republic; nor is there any reason to suppose that he used myths\nor revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction, or that\nhe would have banished poetry or have denounced the Greek mythology.\nHis favorite oath is retained, and a slight mention is made of the\ndaemonium, or internal sign, which is alluded to by Socrates as a\nphenomenon peculiar to himself. A real element of Socratic teaching,\nwhich is more prominent in the Republic than in any of the other Dialogues\nof Plato, is the use of example and illustration ('taphorhtika auto\nprhospherhontez'): \"Let us apply the test of common instances.\" \"You,\"\nsays Adeimantus, ironically, in the sixth book, \"are so unaccustomed\nto speak in images.\" And this use of examples or images, though truly\nSocratic in origin, is enlarged by the genius of Plato into the form\nof an allegory or parable, which embodies in the concrete what has\nbeen already described, or is about to be described, in the abstract.\nThus the figure of the cave in Book VII is a recapitulation of the\ndivisions of knowledge in Book VI. The composite animal in Book IX\nis an allegory of the parts of the soul. The noble captain and the\nship and the true pilot in Book VI are a figure of the relation of\nthe people to the philosophers in the State which has been described.\nOther figures, such as the dog in the second, third, and fourth books,\nor the marriage of the portionless maiden in the sixth book, or the\ndrones and wasps in the eighth and ninth books, also form links of\nconnection in long passages, or are used to recall previous discussions.\n\nPlato is most true to the character of his master when he describes\nhim as \"not of this world.\" And with this representation of him the\nideal State and the other paradoxes of the Republic are quite in accordance,\nthough they can not be shown to have been speculations of Socrates.\nTo him, as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious,\nwhen they looked upward, the world seemed to be the embodiment of\nerror and evil. The common sense of mankind has revolted against this\nview, or has only partially admitted it. And even in Socrates himself\nthe sterner judgment of the multitude at times passes into a sort\nof ironical pity or love. Men in general are incapable of philosophy,\nand are therefore at enmity with the philosopher; but their misunderstanding\nof him is unavoidable: for they have never seen him as he truly is\nin his own image; they are only acquainted with artificial systems\npossessing no native force of truth --words which admit of many applications.\nTheir leaders have nothing to measure with, and are therefore ignorant\nof their own stature. But they are to be pitied or laughed at, not\nto be quarrelled with; they mean well with their nostrums, if they\ncould only learn that they are cutting off a Hydra's head. This moderation\ntowards those who are in error is one of the most characteristic features\nof Socrates in the Republic. In all the different representations\nof Socrates, whether of Xenophon or Plato, and the differences of\nthe earlier or later Dialogues, he always retains the character of\nthe unwearied and disinterested seeker after truth, without which\nhe would have ceased to be Socrates. \n\nLeaving the characters we may now analyze the contents of the Republic,\nand then proceed to consider (1) The general aspects of this Hellenic\nideal of the State, (2) The modern lights in which the thoughts of\nPlato may be read. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK I\n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nI went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston,\nthat I might offer up my prayers to the goddess; and also because\nI wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival,\nwhich was a new thing. I was delighted with the procession of the\ninhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally, if not more, beautiful.\nWhen we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle, we turned\nin the direction of the city; and at that instant Polemarchus the\nson of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we\nwere starting on our way home, and told his servant to run and bid\nus wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak behind,\nand said: Polemarchus desires you to wait. \n\nI turned round, and asked him where his master was. \nThere he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.\n\nCertainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus\nappeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon's brother, Niceratus the\nson of Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.\n\nSocrates - POLEMARCHUS - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS \n\nPolemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and our companion\nare already on your way to the city. \n\nYou are not far wrong, I said. \nBut do you see, he rejoined, how many we are? \nOf course. \nAnd are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to\nremain where you are. \n\nMay there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you\nto let us go? \n\nBut can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.\n\nCertainly not, replied Glaucon. \nThen we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.\n\nAdeimantus added: Has no one told you of the torch-race on horseback\nin honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening?\n\nWith horses! I replied: That is a novelty. Will horsemen carry torches\nand pass them one to another during the race? \n\nYes, said Polemarchus, and not only so, but a festival will he celebrated\nat night, which you certainly ought to see. Let us rise soon after\nsupper and see this festival; there will be a gathering of young men,\nand we will have a good talk. Stay then, and do not be perverse.\n\nGlaucon said: I suppose, since you insist, that we must.\n\nVery good, I replied. \n\nGlaucon - CEPHALUS - SOCRATES \n\nAccordingly we went with Polemarchus to his house; and there we found\nhis brothers Lysias and Euthydemus, and with them Thrasymachus the\nChalcedonian, Charmantides the Paeanian, and Cleitophon the son of\nAristonymus. There too was Cephalus the father of Polemarchus, whom\nI had not seen for a long time, and I thought him very much aged.\nHe was seated on a cushioned chair, and had a garland on his head,\nfor he had been sacrificing in the court; and there were some other\nchairs in the room arranged in a semicircle, upon which we sat down\nby him. He saluted me eagerly, and then he said: -- \n\nYou don't come to see me, Socrates, as often as you ought: If I were\nstill able to go and see you I would not ask you to come to me. But\nat my age I can hardly get to the city, and therefore you should come\noftener to the Piraeus. For let me tell you, that the more the pleasures\nof the body fade away, the greater to me is the pleasure and charm\nof conversation. Do not then deny my request, but make our house your\nresort and keep company with these young men; we are old friends,\nand you will be quite at home with us. \n\nI replied: There is nothing which for my part I like better, Cephalus,\nthan conversing with aged men; for I regard them as travellers who\nhave gone a journey which I too may have to go, and of whom I ought\nto enquire, whether the way is smooth and easy, or rugged and difficult.\nAnd this is a question which I should like to ask of you who have\narrived at that time which the poets call the 'threshold of old age'\n--Is life harder towards the end, or what report do you give of it?\n\nI will tell you, Socrates, he said, what my own feeling is. Men of\nmy age flock together; we are birds of a feather, as the old proverb\nsays; and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is\n--I cannot eat, I cannot drink; the pleasures of youth and love are\nfled away: there was a good time once, but now that is gone, and life\nis no longer life. Some complain of the slights which are put upon\nthem by relations, and they will tell you sadly of how many evils\ntheir old age is the cause. But to me, Socrates, these complainers\nseem to blame that which is not really in fault. For if old age were\nthe cause, I too being old, and every other old man, would have felt\nas they do. But this is not my own experience, nor that of others\nwhom I have known. How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when\nin answer to the question, How does love suit with age, Sophocles,\n--are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most gladly have\nI escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped\nfrom a mad and furious master. His words have often occurred to my\nmind since, and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he\nuttered them. For certainly old age has a great sense of calm and\nfreedom; when the passions relax their hold, then, as Sophocles says,\nwe are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only, but of many.\nThe truth is, Socrates, that these regrets, and also the complaints\nabout relations, are to be attributed to the same cause, which is\nnot old age, but men's characters and tempers; for he who is of a\ncalm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age, but to\nhim who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a\nburden. \n\nI listened in admiration, and wanting to draw him out, that he might\ngo on --Yes, Cephalus, I said: but I rather suspect that people in\ngeneral are not convinced by you when you speak thus; they think that\nold age sits lightly upon you, not because of your happy disposition,\nbut because you are rich, and wealth is well known to be a great comforter.\n\nYou are right, he replied; they are not convinced: and there is something\nin what they say; not, however, so much as they imagine. I might answer\nthem as Themistocles answered the Seriphian who was abusing him and\nsaying that he was famous, not for his own merits but because he was\nan Athenian: 'If you had been a native of my country or I of yours,\nneither of us would have been famous.' And to those who are not rich\nand are impatient of old age, the same reply may be made; for to the\ngood poor man old age cannot be a light burden, nor can a bad rich\nman ever have peace with himself. \n\nMay I ask, Cephalus, whether your fortune was for the most part inherited\nor acquired by you? \n\nAcquired! Socrates; do you want to know how much I acquired? In the\nart of making money I have been midway between my father and grandfather:\nfor my grandfather, whose name I bear, doubled and trebled the value\nof his patrimony, that which he inherited being much what I possess\nnow; but my father Lysanias reduced the property below what it is\nat present: and I shall be satisfied if I leave to these my sons not\nless but a little more than I received. \n\nThat was why I asked you the question, I replied, because I see that\nyou are indifferent about money, which is a characteristic rather\nof those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have\nacquired them; the makers of fortunes have a second love of money\nas a creation of their own, resembling the affection of authors for\ntheir own poems, or of parents for their children, besides that natural\nlove of it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them\nand all men. And hence they are very bad company, for they can talk\nabout nothing but the praises of wealth. That is true, he said.\n\nYes, that is very true, but may I ask another question? What do you\nconsider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your\nwealth? \n\nOne, he said, of which I could not expect easily to convince others.\nFor let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be\nnear death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had\nbefore; the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted\nthere of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now\nhe is tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from\nthe weakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other\nplace, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms\ncrowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what\nwrongs he has done to others. And when he finds that the sum of his\ntransgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up\nin his sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings. But\nto him who is conscious of no sin, sweet hope, as Pindar charmingly\nsays, is the kind nurse of his age: \n\nHope, he says, cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and\nholiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey;\n--hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man.\n\nHow admirable are his words! And the great blessing of riches, I do\nnot say to every man, but to a good man, is, that he has had no occasion\nto deceive or to defraud others, either intentionally or unintentionally;\nand when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension\nabout offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men. Now\nto this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes;\nand therefore I say, that, setting one thing against another, of the\nmany advantages which wealth has to give, to a man of sense this is\nin my opinion the greatest. \n\nWell said, Cephalus, I replied; but as concerning justice, what is\nit? --to speak the truth and to pay your debts --no more than this?\nAnd even to this are there not exceptions? Suppose that a friend when\nin his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them\nwhen he is not in his right mind, ought I to give them back to him?\nNo one would say that I ought or that I should be right in doing so,\nany more than they would say that I ought always to speak the truth\nto one who is in his condition. \n\nYou are quite right, he replied. \nBut then, I said, speaking the truth and paying your debts is not\na correct definition of justice. \n\nCephalus - SOCRATES - POLEMARCHUS \n\nQuite correct, Socrates, if Simonides is to be believed, said Polemarchus\ninterposing. \n\nI fear, said Cephalus, that I must go now, for I have to look after\nthe sacrifices, and I hand over the argument to Polemarchus and the\ncompany. \n\nIs not Polemarchus your heir? I said. \nTo be sure, he answered, and went away laughing to the sacrifices.\n\nSocrates - POLEMARCHUS \n\nTell me then, O thou heir of the argument, what did Simonides say,\nand according to you truly say, about justice? \n\nHe said that the repayment of a debt is just, and in saying so he\nappears to me to be right. \n\nI should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man,\nbut his meaning, though probably clear to you, is the reverse of clear\nto me. For he certainly does not mean, as we were now saying that\nI ought to return a return a deposit of arms or of anything else to\none who asks for it when he is not in his right senses; and yet a\ndeposit cannot be denied to be a debt. \n\nTrue. \nThen when the person who asks me is not in his right mind I am by\nno means to make the return? \n\nCertainly not. \nWhen Simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice, he did\nnot mean to include that case? \n\nCertainly not; for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good\nto a friend and never evil. \n\nYou mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury\nof the receiver, if the two parties are friends, is not the repayment\nof a debt, --that is what you would imagine him to say? \n\nYes. \nAnd are enemies also to receive what we owe to them? \nTo be sure, he said, they are to receive what we owe them, and an\nenemy, as I take it, owes to an enemy that which is due or proper\nto him --that is to say, evil. \n\nSimonides, then, after the manner of poets, would seem to have spoken\ndarkly of the nature of justice; for he really meant to say that justice\nis the giving to each man what is proper to him, and this he termed\na debt. \n\nThat must have been his meaning, he said. \nBy heaven! I replied; and if we asked him what due or proper thing\nis given by medicine, and to whom, what answer do you think that he\nwould make to us? \n\nHe would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink\nto human bodies. \n\nAnd what due or proper thing is given by cookery, and to what?\n\nSeasoning to food. \nAnd what is that which justice gives, and to whom? \nIf, Socrates, we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding\ninstances, then justice is the art which gives good to friends and\nevil to enemies. \n\nThat is his meaning then? \nI think so. \nAnd who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies\nin time of sickness? \n\nThe physician. \nOr when they are on a voyage, amid the perils of the sea?\n\nThe pilot. \nAnd in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just\nman most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friends?\n\nIn going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other.\n\nBut when a man is well, my dear Polemarchus, there is no need of a\nphysician? \n\nNo. \nAnd he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot? \nNo. \nThen in time of peace justice will be of no use? \nI am very far from thinking so. \nYou think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war?\n\nYes. \nLike husbandry for the acquisition of corn? \nYes. \nOr like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes, --that is what you\nmean? \n\nYes. \nAnd what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of\npeace? \n\nIn contracts, Socrates, justice is of use. \nAnd by contracts you mean partnerships? \nExactly. \nBut is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better\npartner at a game of draughts? \n\nThe skilful player. \nAnd in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful\nor better partner than the builder? \n\nQuite the reverse. \nThen in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner\nthan the harp-player, as in playing the harp the harp-player is certainly\na better partner than the just man? \n\nIn a money partnership. \nYes, Polemarchus, but surely not in the use of money; for you do not\nwant a just man to be your counsellor the purchase or sale of a horse;\na man who is knowing about horses would be better for that, would\nhe not? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd when you want to buy a ship, the shipwright or the pilot would\nbe better? \n\nTrue. \nThen what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man\nis to be preferred? \n\nWhen you want a deposit to be kept safely. \nYou mean when money is not wanted, but allowed to lie? \nPrecisely. \nThat is to say, justice is useful when money is useless?\n\nThat is the inference. \nAnd when you want to keep a pruning-hook safe, then justice is useful\nto the individual and to the state; but when you want to use it, then\nthe art of the vine-dresser? \n\nClearly. \nAnd when you want to keep a shield or a lyre, and not to use them,\nyou would say that justice is useful; but when you want to use them,\nthen the art of the soldier or of the musician? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd so of all the other things; --justice is useful when they are\nuseless, and useless when they are useful? \n\nThat is the inference. \nThen justice is not good for much. But let us consider this further\npoint: Is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in\nany kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease\nis best able to create one? \n\nTrue. \nAnd he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march\nupon the enemy? \n\nCertainly. \nThen he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief?\n\nThat, I suppose, is to be inferred. \nThen if the just man is good at keeping money, he is good at stealing\nit. \n\nThat is implied in the argument. \nThen after all the just man has turned out to be a thief. And this\nis a lesson which I suspect you must have learnt out of Homer; for\nhe, speaking of Autolycus, the maternal grandfather of Odysseus, who\nis a favourite of his, affirms that \n\nHe was excellent above all men in theft and perjury. And so, you and\nHomer and Simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft; to\nbe practised however 'for the good of friends and for the harm of\nenemies,' --that was what you were saying? \n\nNo, certainly not that, though I do not now know what I did say; but\nI still stand by the latter words. \n\nWell, there is another question: By friends and enemies do we mean\nthose who are so really, or only in seeming? \n\nSurely, he said, a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks\ngood, and to hate those whom he thinks evil. \n\nYes, but do not persons often err about good and evil: many who are\nnot good seem to be so, and conversely? \n\nThat is true. \nThen to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends?\nTrue. \n\nAnd in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and\nevil to the good? \n\nClearly. \nBut the good are just and would not do an injustice? \nTrue. \nThen according to your argument it is just to injure those who do\nno wrong? \n\nNay, Socrates; the doctrine is immoral. \nThen I suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the\nunjust? \n\nI like that better. \nBut see the consequence: --Many a man who is ignorant of human nature\nhas friends who are bad friends, and in that case he ought to do harm\nto them; and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit; but, if\nso, we shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed\nto be the meaning of Simonides. \n\nVery true, he said: and I think that we had better correct an error\ninto which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words 'friend'\nand 'enemy.' \n\nWhat was the error, Polemarchus? I asked. \nWe assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good.\n\nAnd how is the error to be corrected? \nWe should rather say that he is a friend who is, as well as seems,\ngood; and that he who seems only, and is not good, only seems to be\nand is not a friend; and of an enemy the same may be said.\n\nYou would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies?\n\nYes. \nAnd instead of saying simply as we did at first, that it is just to\ndo good to our friends and harm to our enemies, we should further\nsay: It is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm\nto our enemies when they are evil? \n\nYes, that appears to me to be the truth. \nBut ought the just to injure any one at all? \nUndoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies.\n\nWhen horses are injured, are they improved or deteriorated?\n\nThe latter. \nDeteriorated, that is to say, in the good qualities of horses, not\nof dogs? \n\nYes, of horses. \nAnd dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs, and not of\nhorses? \n\nOf course. \nAnd will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is\nthe proper virtue of man? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd that human virtue is justice? \nTo be sure. \nThen men who are injured are of necessity made unjust? \nThat is the result. \nBut can the musician by his art make men unmusical? \nCertainly not. \nOr the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen? \nImpossible. \nAnd can the just by justice make men unjust, or speaking general can\nthe good by virtue make them bad? \n\nAssuredly not. \nAny more than heat can produce cold? \nIt cannot. \nOr drought moisture? \nClearly not. \nNor can the good harm any one? \nImpossible. \nAnd the just is the good? \nCertainly. \nThen to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man,\nbut of the opposite, who is the unjust? \n\nI think that what you say is quite true, Socrates. \nThen if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts,\nand that good is the debt which a man owes to his friends, and evil\nthe debt which he owes to his enemies, --to say this is not wise;\nfor it is not true, if, as has been clearly shown, the injuring of\nanother can be in no case just. \n\nI agree with you, said Polemarchus. \nThen you and I are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes\nsuch a saying to Simonides or Bias or Pittacus, or any other wise\nman or seer? \n\nI am quite ready to do battle at your side, he said. \nShall I tell you whose I believe the saying to be? \nWhose? \nI believe that Periander or Perdiccas or Xerxes or Ismenias the Theban,\nor some other rich and mighty man, who had a great opinion of his\nown power, was the first to say that justice is 'doing good to your\nfriends and harm to your enemies.' \n\nMost true, he said. \nYes, I said; but if this definition of justice also breaks down, what\nother can be offered? \n\nSeveral times in the course of the discussion Thrasymachus had made\nan attempt to get the argument into his own hands, and had been put\ndown by the rest of the company, who wanted to hear the end. But when\nPolemarchus and I had done speaking and there was a pause, he could\nno longer hold his peace; and, gathering himself up, he came at us\nlike a wild beast, seeking to devour us. We were quite panic-stricken\nat the sight of him. \n\nSocrates - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS \n\nHe roared out to the whole company: What folly. Socrates, has taken\npossession of you all? And why, sillybillies, do you knock under to\none another? I say that if you want really to know what justice is,\nyou should not only ask but answer, and you should not seek honour\nto yourself from the refutation of an opponent, but have your own\nanswer; for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer. And\nnow I will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit\nor gain or interest, for this sort of nonsense will not do for me;\nI must have clearness and accuracy. \n\nI was panic-stricken at his words, and could not look at him without\ntrembling. Indeed I believe that if I had not fixed my eye upon him,\nI should have been struck dumb: but when I saw his fury rising, I\nlooked at him first, and was therefore able to reply to him.\n\nThrasymachus, I said, with a quiver, don't be hard upon us. Polemarchus\nand I may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument, but\nI can assure you that the error was not intentional. If we were seeking\nfor a piece of gold, you would not imagine that we were 'knocking\nunder to one another,' and so losing our chance of finding it. And\nwhy, when we are seeking for justice, a thing more precious than many\npieces of gold, do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another\nand not doing our utmost to get at the truth? Nay, my good friend,\nwe are most willing and anxious to do so, but the fact is that we\ncannot. And if so, you people who know all things should pity us and\nnot be angry with us. \n\nHow characteristic of Socrates! he replied, with a bitter laugh; --that's\nyour ironical style! Did I not foresee --have I not already told you,\nthat whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer, and try irony\nor any other shuffle, in order that he might avoid answering?\n\nYou are a philosopher, Thrasymachus, I replied, and well know that\nif you ask a person what numbers make up twelve, taking care to prohibit\nhim whom you ask from answering twice six, or three times four, or\nsix times two, or four times three, 'for this sort of nonsense will\nnot do for me,' --then obviously, that is your way of putting the\nquestion, no one can answer you. But suppose that he were to retort,\n'Thrasymachus, what do you mean? If one of these numbers which you\ninterdict be the true answer to the question, am I falsely to say\nsome other number which is not the right one? --is that your meaning?'\n-How would you answer him? \n\nJust as if the two cases were at all alike! he said. \nWhy should they not be? I replied; and even if they are not, but only\nappear to be so to the person who is asked, ought he not to say what\nhe thinks, whether you and I forbid him or not? \n\nI presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers?\n\nI dare say that I may, notwithstanding the danger, if upon reflection\nI approve of any of them. \n\nBut what if I give you an answer about justice other and better, he\nsaid, than any of these? What do you deserve to have done to you?\n\nDone to me! --as becomes the ignorant, I must learn from the wise\n--that is what I deserve to have done to me. \n\nWhat, and no payment! a pleasant notion! \nI will pay when I have the money, I replied. \n\nSocrates - THRASYMACHUS - GLAUCON \n\nBut you have, Socrates, said Glaucon: and you, Thrasymachus, need\nbe under no anxiety about money, for we will all make a contribution\nfor Socrates. \n\nYes, he replied, and then Socrates will do as he always does --refuse\nto answer himself, but take and pull to pieces the answer of some\none else. \n\nWhy, my good friend, I said, how can any one answer who knows, and\nsays that he knows, just nothing; and who, even if he has some faint\nnotions of his own, is told by a man of authority not to utter them?\nThe natural thing is, that the speaker should be some one like yourself\nwho professes to know and can tell what he knows. Will you then kindly\nanswer, for the edification of the company and of myself ?\n\nGlaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and Thrasymachus,\nas any one might see, was in reality eager to speak; for he thought\nthat he had an excellent answer, and would distinguish himself. But\nat first he to insist on my answering; at length he consented to begin.\nBehold, he said, the wisdom of Socrates; he refuses to teach himself,\nand goes about learning of others, to whom he never even says thank\nyou. \n\nThat I learn of others, I replied, is quite true; but that I am ungrateful\nI wholly deny. Money I have none, and therefore I pay in praise, which\nis all I have: and how ready I am to praise any one who appears to\nme to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer; for\nI expect that you will answer well. \n\nListen, then, he said; I proclaim that justice is nothing else than\nthe interest of the stronger. And now why do you not me? But of course\nyou won't. \n\nLet me first understand you, I replied. justice, as you say, is the\ninterest of the stronger. What, Thrasymachus, is the meaning of this?\nYou cannot mean to say that because Polydamas, the pancratiast, is\nstronger than we are, and finds the eating of beef conducive to his\nbodily strength, that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good\nwho are weaker than he is, and right and just for us? \n\nThat's abominable of you, Socrates; you take the words in the sense\nwhich is most damaging to the argument. \n\nNot at all, my good sir, I said; I am trying to understand them; and\nI wish that you would be a little clearer. \n\nWell, he said, have you never heard that forms of government differ;\nthere are tyrannies, and there are democracies, and there are aristocracies?\n\nYes, I know. \nAnd the government is the ruling power in each state? \nCertainly. \nAnd the different forms of government make laws democratical, aristocratical,\ntyrannical, with a view to their several interests; and these laws,\nwhich are made by them for their own interests, are the justice which\nthey deliver to their subjects, and him who transgresses them they\npunish as a breaker of the law, and unjust. And that is what I mean\nwhen I say that in all states there is the same principle of justice,\nwhich is the interest of the government; and as the government must\nbe supposed to have power, the only reasonable conclusion is, that\neverywhere there is one principle of justice, which is the interest\nof the stronger. \n\nNow I understand you, I said; and whether you are right or not I will\ntry to discover. But let me remark, that in defining justice you have\nyourself used the word 'interest' which you forbade me to use. It\nis true, however, that in your definition the words 'of the stronger'\nare added. \n\nA small addition, you must allow, he said. \nGreat or small, never mind about that: we must first enquire whether\nwhat you are saying is the truth. Now we are both agreed that justice\nis interest of some sort, but you go on to say 'of the stronger';\nabout this addition I am not so sure, and must therefore consider\nfurther. \n\nProceed. \nI will; and first tell me, Do you admit that it is just or subjects\nto obey their rulers? \n\nI do. \nBut are the rulers of states absolutely infallible, or are they sometimes\nliable to err? \n\nTo be sure, he replied, they are liable to err. \nThen in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly, and\nsometimes not? \n\nTrue. \nWhen they make them rightly, they make them agreeably to their interest;\nwhen they are mistaken, contrary to their interest; you admit that?\n\nYes. \nAnd the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects, --and\nthat is what you call justice? \n\nDoubtless. \nThen justice, according to your argument, is not only obedience to\nthe interest of the stronger but the reverse? \n\nWhat is that you are saying? he asked. \nI am only repeating what you are saying, I believe. But let us consider:\nHave we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own\ninterest in what they command, and also that to obey them is justice?\nHas not that been admitted? \n\nYes. \nThen you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest\nof the stronger, when the rulers unintentionally command things to\nbe done which are to their own injury. For if, as you say, justice\nis the obedience which the subject renders to their commands, in that\ncase, O wisest of men, is there any escape from the conclusion that\nthe weaker are commanded to do, not what is for the interest, but\nwhat is for the injury of the stronger? \n\nNothing can be clearer, Socrates, said Polemarchus. \n\nSocrates - CLEITOPHON - POLEMARCHUS - THRASYMACHUS \n\nYes, said Cleitophon, interposing, if you are allowed to be his witness.\n\nBut there is no need of any witness, said Polemarchus, for Thrasymachus\nhimself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not\nfor their own interest, and that for subjects to obey them is justice.\n\nYes, Polemarchus, --Thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what\nwas commanded by their rulers is just. \n\nYes, Cleitophon, but he also said that justice is the interest of\nthe stronger, and, while admitting both these propositions, he further\nacknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his\nsubjects to do what is not for his own interest; whence follows that\njustice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger.\n\nBut, said Cleitophon, he meant by the interest of the stronger what\nthe stronger thought to be his interest, --this was what the weaker\nhad to do; and this was affirmed by him to be justice. \n\nThose were not his words, rejoined Polemarchus. \n\nSocrates - THRASYMACHUS \n\nNever mind, I replied, if he now says that they are, let us accept\nhis statement. Tell me, Thrasymachus, I said, did you mean by justice\nwhat the stronger thought to be his interest, whether really so or\nnot? \n\nCertainly not, he said. Do you suppose that I call him who is mistaken\nthe stronger at the time when he is mistaken? \n\nYes, I said, my impression was that you did so, when you admitted\nthat the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken.\n\nYou argue like an informer, Socrates. Do you mean, for example, that\nhe who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken?\nor that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or\ngrammarian at the me when he is making the mistake, in respect of\nthe mistake? True, we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian\nhas made a mistake, but this is only a way of speaking; for the fact\nis that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever\nmakes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies; they none\nof them err unless their skill fails them, and then they cease to\nbe skilled artists. No artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when\nhe is what his name implies; though he is commonly said to err, and\nI adopted the common mode of speaking. But to be perfectly accurate,\nsince you are such a lover of accuracy, we should say that the ruler,\nin so far as he is the ruler, is unerring, and, being unerring, always\ncommands that which is for his own interest; and the subject is required\nto execute his commands; and therefore, as I said at first and now\nrepeat, justice is the interest of the stronger. \n\nIndeed, Thrasymachus, and do I really appear to you to argue like\nan informer? \n\nCertainly, he replied. \nAnd you suppose that I ask these questions with any design of injuring\nyou in the argument? \n\nNay, he replied, 'suppose' is not the word --I know it; but you will\nbe found out, and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail.\n\nI shall not make the attempt, my dear man; but to avoid any misunderstanding\noccurring between us in future, let me ask, in what sense do you speak\nof a ruler or stronger whose interest, as you were saying, he being\nthe superior, it is just that the inferior should execute --is he\na ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the term?\n\nIn the strictest of all senses, he said. And now cheat and play the\ninformer if you can; I ask no quarter at your hands. But you never\nwill be able, never. \n\nAnd do you imagine, I said, that I am such a madman as to try and\ncheat, Thrasymachus? I might as well shave a lion. \n\nWhy, he said, you made the attempt a minute ago, and you failed.\n\nEnough, I said, of these civilities. It will be better that I should\nask you a question: Is the physician, taken in that strict sense of\nwhich you are speaking, a healer of the sick or a maker of money?\nAnd remember that I am now speaking of the true physician.\n\nA healer of the sick, he replied. \nAnd the pilot --that is to say, the true pilot --is he a captain of\nsailors or a mere sailor? \n\nA captain of sailors. \nThe circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into\naccount; neither is he to be called a sailor; the name pilot by which\nhe is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing, but is significant\nof his skill and of his authority over the sailors. \n\nVery true, he said. \nNow, I said, every art has an interest? \nCertainly. \nFor which the art has to consider and provide? \nYes, that is the aim of art. \nAnd the interest of any art is the perfection of it --this and nothing\nelse? \n\nWhat do you mean? \nI mean what I may illustrate negatively by the example of the body.\nSuppose you were to ask me whether the body is self-sufficing or has\nwants, I should reply: Certainly the body has wants; for the body\nmay be ill and require to be cured, and has therefore interests to\nwhich the art of medicine ministers; and this is the origin and intention\nof medicine, as you will acknowledge. Am I not right? \n\nQuite right, he replied. \nBut is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in\nany quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight\nor the ear fail of hearing, and therefore requires another art to\nprovide for the interests of seeing and hearing --has art in itself,\nI say, any similar liability to fault or defect, and does every art\nrequire another supplementary art to provide for its interests, and\nthat another and another without end? Or have the arts to look only\nafter their own interests? Or have they no need either of themselves\nor of another? --having no faults or defects, they have no need to\ncorrect them, either by the exercise of their own art or of any other;\nthey have only to consider the interest of their subject-matter. For\nevery art remains pure and faultless while remaining true --that is\nto say, while perfect and unimpaired. Take the words in your precise\nsense, and tell me whether I am not right.\" \n\nYes, clearly. \nThen medicine does not consider the interest of medicine, but the\ninterest of the body? \n\nTrue, he said. \nNor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art\nof horsemanship, but the interests of the horse; neither do any other\narts care for themselves, for they have no needs; they care only for\nthat which is the subject of their art? \n\nTrue, he said. \nBut surely, Thrasymachus, the arts are the superiors and rulers of\ntheir own subjects? \n\nTo this he assented with a good deal of reluctance. \nThen, I said, no science or art considers or enjoins the interest\nof the stronger or superior, but only the interest of the subject\nand weaker? \n\nHe made an attempt to contest this proposition also, but finally acquiesced.\n\nThen, I continued, no physician, in so far as he is a physician, considers\nhis own good in what he prescribes, but the good of his patient; for\nthe true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject,\nand is not a mere money-maker; that has been admitted? \n\nYes. \nAnd the pilot likewise, in the strict sense of the term, is a ruler\nof sailors and not a mere sailor? \n\nThat has been admitted. \nAnd such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest\nof the sailor who is under him, and not for his own or the ruler's\ninterest? \n\nHe gave a reluctant 'Yes.' \nThen, I said, Thrasymachus, there is no one in any rule who, in so\nfar as he is a ruler, considers or enjoins what is for his own interest,\nbut always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to\nhis art; to that he looks, and that alone he considers in everything\nwhich he says and does. \n\nWhen we had got to this point in the argument, and every one saw that\nthe definition of justice had been completely upset, Thrasymachus,\ninstead of replying to me, said: Tell me, Socrates, have you got a\nnurse? \n\nWhy do you ask such a question, I said, when you ought rather to be\nanswering? \n\nBecause she leaves you to snivel, and never wipes your nose: she has\nnot even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep.\n\nWhat makes you say that? I replied. \nBecause you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens of tends the\nsheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of\nhimself or his master; and you further imagine that the rulers of\nstates, if they are true rulers, never think of their subjects as\nsheep, and that they are not studying their own advantage day and\nnight. Oh, no; and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about\nthe just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the just\nare in reality another's good; that is to say, the interest of the\nruler and stronger, and the loss of the subject and servant; and injustice\nthe opposite; for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just:\nhe is the stronger, and his subjects do what is for his interest,\nand minister to his happiness, which is very far from being their\nown. Consider further, most foolish Socrates, that the just is always\na loser in comparison with the unjust. First of all, in private contracts:\nwherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find that,\nwhen the partnership is dissolved, the unjust man has always more\nand the just less. Secondly, in their dealings with the State: when\nthere is an income tax, the just man will pay more and the unjust\nless on the same amount of income; and when there is anything to be\nreceived the one gains nothing and the other much. Observe also what\nhappens when they take an office; there is the just man neglecting\nhis affairs and perhaps suffering other losses, and getting nothing\nout of the public, because he is just; moreover he is hated by his\nfriends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways.\nBut all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man. I am speaking,\nas before, of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage of\nthe unjust is more apparent; and my meaning will be most clearly seen\nif we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the criminal\nis the happiest of men, and the sufferers or those who refuse to do\ninjustice are the most miserable --that is to say tyranny, which by\nfraud and force takes away the property of others, not little by little\nbut wholesale; comprehending in one, things sacred as well as profane,\nprivate and public; for which acts of wrong, if he were detected perpetrating\nany one of them singly, he would be punished and incur great disgrace\n--they who do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of\ntemples, and man-stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves.\nBut when a man besides taking away the money of the citizens has made\nslaves of them, then, instead of these names of reproach, he is termed\nhappy and blessed, not only by the citizens but by all who hear of\nhis having achieved the consummation of injustice. For mankind censure\ninjustice, fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because\nthey shrink from committing it. And thus, as I have shown, Socrates,\ninjustice, when on a sufficient scale, has more strength and freedom\nand mastery than justice; and, as I said at first, justice is the\ninterest of the stronger, whereas injustice is a man's own profit\nand interest. \n\nThrasymachus, when he had thus spoken, having, like a bathman, deluged\nour ears with his words, had a mind to go away. But the company would\nnot let him; they insisted that he should remain and defend his position;\nand I myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us.\nThrasymachus, I said to him, excellent man, how suggestive are your\nremarks! And are you going to run away before you have fairly taught\nor learned whether they are true or not? Is the attempt to determine\nthe way of man's life so small a matter in your eyes --to determine\nhow life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage?\n\nAnd do I differ from you, he said, as to the importance of the enquiry?\n\nYou appear rather, I replied, to have no care or thought about us,\nThrasymachus --whether we live better or worse from not knowing what\nyou say you know, is to you a matter of indifference. Prithee, friend,\ndo not keep your knowledge to yourself; we are a large party; and\nany benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded. For my\nown part I openly declare that I am not convinced, and that I do not\nbelieve injustice to be more gainful than justice, even if uncontrolled\nand allowed to have free play. For, granting that there may be an\nunjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force,\nstill this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice,\nand there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself.\nPerhaps we may be wrong; if so, you in your wisdom should convince\nus that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice.\n\nAnd how am I to convince you, he said, if you are not already convinced\nby what I have just said; what more can I do for you? Would you have\nme put the proof bodily into your souls? \n\nHeaven forbid! I said; I would only ask you to be consistent; or,\nif you change, change openly and let there be no deception. For I\nmust remark, Thrasymachus, if you will recall what was previously\nsaid, that although you began by defining the true physician in an\nexact sense, you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of\nthe shepherd; you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the\nsheep not with a view to their own good, but like a mere diner or\nbanqueter with a view to the pleasures of the table; or, again, as\na trader for sale in the market, and not as a shepherd. Yet surely\nthe art of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his subjects;\nhe has only to provide the best for them, since the perfection of\nthe art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it are\nsatisfied. And that was what I was saying just now about the ruler.\nI conceived that the art of the ruler, considered as ruler, whether\nin a state or in private life, could only regard the good of his flock\nor subjects; whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states,\nthat is to say, the true rulers, like being in authority.\n\nThink! Nay, I am sure of it. \nThen why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly\nwithout payment, unless under the idea that they govern for the advantage\nnot of themselves but of others? Let me ask you a question: Are not\nthe several arts different, by reason of their each having a separate\nfunction? And, my dear illustrious friend, do say what you think,\nthat we may make a little progress. \n\nYes, that is the difference, he replied. \nAnd each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one\n--medicine, for example, gives us health; navigation, safety at sea,\nand so on? \n\nYes, he said. \nAnd the art of payment has the special function of giving pay: but\nwe do not confuse this with other arts, any more than the art of the\npilot is to be confused with the art of medicine, because the health\nof the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage. You would not be inclined\nto say, would you, that navigation is the art of medicine, at least\nif we are to adopt your exact use of language? \n\nCertainly not. \nOr because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would\nnot say that the art of payment is medicine? \n\nI should say not. \nNor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because\na man takes fees when he is engaged in healing? \n\nCertainly not. \nAnd we have admitted, I said, that the good of each art is specially\nconfined to the art? \n\nYes. \nThen, if there be any good which all artists have in common, that\nis to be attributed to something of which they all have the common\nuse? \n\nTrue, he replied. \nAnd when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is\ngained by an additional use of the art of pay, which is not the art\nprofessed by him? \n\nHe gave a reluctant assent to this. \nThen the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective\narts. But the truth is, that while the art of medicine gives health,\nand the art of the builder builds a house, another art attends them\nwhich is the art of pay. The various arts may be doing their own business\nand benefiting that over which they preside, but would the artist\nreceive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well?\n\nI suppose not. \nBut does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing?\n\nCertainly, he confers a benefit. \nThen now, Thrasymachus, there is no longer any doubt that neither\narts nor governments provide for their own interests; but, as we were\nbefore saying, they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects\nwho are the weaker and not the stronger --to their good they attend\nand not to the good of the superior. \n\nAnd this is the reason, my dear Thrasymachus, why, as I was just now\nsaying, no one is willing to govern; because no one likes to take\nin hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern without\nremuneration. For, in the execution of his work, and in giving his\norders to another, the true artist does not regard his own interest,\nbut always that of his subjects; and therefore in order that rulers\nmay be willing to rule, they must be paid in one of three modes of\npayment: money, or honour, or a penalty for refusing. \n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nWhat do you mean, Socrates? said Glaucon. The first two modes of payment\nare intelligible enough, but what the penalty is I do not understand,\nor how a penalty can be a payment. \n\nYou mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which\nto the best men is the great inducement to rule? Of course you know\nthat ambition and avarice are held to be, as indeed they are, a disgrace?\n\nVery true. \nAnd for this reason, I said, money and honour have no attraction for\nthem; good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing\nand so to get the name of hirelings, nor by secretly helping themselves\nout of the public revenues to get the name of thieves. And not being\nambitious they do not care about honour. Wherefore necessity must\nbe laid upon them, and they must be induced to serve from the fear\nof punishment. And this, as I imagine, is the reason why the forwardness\nto take office, instead of waiting to be compelled, has been deemed\ndishonourable. Now the worst part of the punishment is that he who\nrefuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself.\nAnd the fear of this, as I conceive, induces the good to take office,\nnot because they would, but because they cannot help --not under the\nidea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves,\nbut as a necessity, and because they are not able to commit the task\nof ruling to any one who is better than themselves, or indeed as good.\nFor there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely\nof good men, then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention\nas to obtain office is at present; then we should have plain proof\nthat the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest,\nbut that of his subjects; and every one who knew this would choose\nrather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble\nof conferring one. So far am I from agreeing with Thrasymachus that\njustice is the interest of the stronger. This latter question need\nnot be further discussed at present; but when Thrasymachus says that\nthe life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of the just,\nhis new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious character.\nWhich of us has spoken truly? And which sort of life, Glaucon, do\nyou prefer? \n\nI for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous,\nhe answered. \n\nDid you hear all the advantages of the unjust which Thrasymachus was\nrehearsing? \n\nYes, I heard him, he replied, but he has not convinced me.\n\nThen shall we try to find some way of convincing him, if we can, that\nhe is saying what is not true? \n\nMost certainly, he replied. \nIf, I said, he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all\nthe advantages of being just, and he answers and we rejoin, there\nmust be a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on\neither side, and in the end we shall want judges to decide; but if\nwe proceed in our enquiry as we lately did, by making admissions to\none another, we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our\nown persons. \n\nVery good, he said. \nAnd which method do I understand you to prefer? I said. \nThat which you propose. \nWell, then, Thrasymachus, I said, suppose you begin at the beginning\nand answer me. You say that perfect injustice is more gainful than\nperfect justice? \n\nSocrates - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS \n\nYes, that is what I say, and I have given you my reasons.\n\nAnd what is your view about them? Would you call one of them virtue\nand the other vice? \n\nCertainly. \nI suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice?\n\nWhat a charming notion! So likely too, seeing that I affirm injustice\nto be profitable and justice not. \n\nWhat else then would you say? \nThe opposite, he replied. \nAnd would you call justice vice? \nNo, I would rather say sublime simplicity. \nThen would you call injustice malignity? \nNo; I would rather say discretion. \nAnd do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good? \nYes, he said; at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly\nunjust, and who have the power of subduing states and nations; but\nperhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses. \n\nEven this profession if undetected has advantages, though they are\nnot to be compared with those of which I was just now speaking.\n\nI do not think that I misapprehend your meaning, Thrasymachus, I replied;\nbut still I cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice\nwith wisdom and virtue, and justice with the opposite. \n\nCertainly I do so class them. \nNow, I said, you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground;\nfor if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had\nbeen admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity, an answer\nmight have been given to you on received principles; but now I perceive\nthat you will call injustice honourable and strong, and to the unjust\nyou will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before\nto the just, seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with\nwisdom and virtue. \n\nYou have guessed most infallibly, he replied. \nThen I certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument\nso long as I have reason to think that you, Thrasymachus, are speaking\nyour real mind; for I do believe that you are now in earnest and are\nnot amusing yourself at our expense. \n\nI may be in earnest or not, but what is that to you? --to refute the\nargument is your business. \n\nVery true, I said; that is what I have to do: But will you be so good\nas answer yet one more question? Does the just man try to gain any\nadvantage over the just? \n\nFar otherwise; if he did would not be the simple, amusing creature\nwhich he is. \n\nAnd would he try to go beyond just action? \nHe would not. \nAnd how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the\nunjust; would that be considered by him as just or unjust?\n\nHe would think it just, and would try to gain the advantage; but he\nwould not be able. \n\nWhether he would or would not be able, I said, is not to the point.\nMy question is only whether the just man, while refusing to have more\nthan another just man, would wish and claim to have more than the\nunjust? \n\nYes, he would. \nAnd what of the unjust --does he claim to have more than the just\nman and to do more than is just \n\nOf course, he said, for he claims to have more than all men.\n\nAnd the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the\nunjust man or action, in order that he may have more than all?\n\nTrue. \nWe may put the matter thus, I said --the just does not desire more\nthan his like but more than his unlike, whereas the unjust desires\nmore than both his like and his unlike? \n\nNothing, he said, can be better than that statement. \nAnd the unjust is good and wise, and the just is neither?\n\nGood again, he said. \nAnd is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them?\n\nOf course, he said, he who is of a certain nature, is like those who\nare of a certain nature; he who is not, not. \n\nEach of them, I said, is such as his like is? \nCertainly, he replied. \nVery good, Thrasymachus, I said; and now to take the case of the arts:\nyou would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician?\n\nYes. \nAnd which is wise and which is foolish? \nClearly the musician is wise, and he who is not a musician is foolish.\n\nAnd he is good in as far as he is wise, and bad in as far as he is\nfoolish? \n\nYes. \nAnd you would say the same sort of thing of the physician?\n\nYes. \nAnd do you think, my excellent friend, that a musician when he adjusts\nthe lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in\nthe tightening and loosening the strings? \n\nI do not think that he would. \nBut he would claim to exceed the non-musician? \nOf course. \nAnd what would you say of the physician? In prescribing meats and\ndrinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the\npractice of medicine? \n\nHe would not. \nBut he would wish to go beyond the non-physician? \nYes. \nAnd about knowledge and ignorance in general; see whether you think\nthat any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice\nof saying or doing more than another man who has knowledge. Would\nhe not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case?\n\nThat, I suppose, can hardly be denied. \nAnd what of the ignorant? would he not desire to have more than either\nthe knowing or the ignorant? \n\nI dare say. \nAnd the knowing is wise? \nYes. \nAnd the wise is good? \nTrue. \nThen the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like,\nbut more than his unlike and opposite? \n\nI suppose so. \nWhereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both?\n\nYes. \nBut did we not say, Thrasymachus, that the unjust goes beyond both\nhis like and unlike? Were not these your words? They were.\n\nThey were. \nAnd you also said that the lust will not go beyond his like but his\nunlike? \n\nYes. \nThen the just is like the wise and good, and the unjust like the evil\nand ignorant? \n\nThat is the inference. \nAnd each of them is such as his like is? \nThat was admitted. \nThen the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil\nand ignorant. \n\nThrasymachus made all these admissions, not fluently, as I repeat\nthem, but with extreme reluctance; it was a hot summer's day, and\nthe perspiration poured from him in torrents; and then I saw what\nI had never seen before, Thrasymachus blushing. As we were now agreed\nthat justice was virtue and wisdom, and injustice vice and ignorance,\nI proceeded to another point: \n\nWell, I said, Thrasymachus, that matter is now settled; but were we\nnot also saying that injustice had strength; do you remember?\n\nYes, I remember, he said, but do not suppose that I approve of what\nyou are saying or have no answer; if however I were to answer, you\nwould be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing; therefore either\npermit me to have my say out, or if you would rather ask, do so, and\nI will answer 'Very good,' as they say to story-telling old women,\nand will nod 'Yes' and 'No.' \n\nCertainly not, I said, if contrary to your real opinion.\n\nYes, he said, I will, to please you, since you will not let me speak.\nWhat else would you have? \n\nNothing in the world, I said; and if you are so disposed I will ask\nand you shall answer. \n\nProceed. \nThen I will repeat the question which I asked before, in order that\nour examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may\nbe carried on regularly. A statement was made that injustice is stronger\nand more powerful than justice, but now justice, having been identified\nwith wisdom and virtue, is easily shown to be stronger than injustice,\nif injustice is ignorance; this can no longer be questioned by any\none. But I want to view the matter, Thrasymachus, in a different way:\nYou would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly\nattempting to enslave other states, or may have already enslaved them,\nand may be holding many of them in subjection? \n\nTrue, he replied; and I will add the best and perfectly unjust state\nwill be most likely to do so. \n\nI know, I said, that such was your position; but what I would further\nconsider is, whether this power which is possessed by the superior\nstate can exist or be exercised without justice. \n\nIf you are right in you view, and justice is wisdom, then only with\njustice; but if I am right, then without justice. \n\nI am delighted, Thrasymachus, to see you not only nodding assent and\ndissent, but making answers which are quite excellent. \n\nThat is out of civility to you, he replied. \nYou are very kind, I said; and would you have the goodness also to\ninform me, whether you think that a state, or an army, or a band of\nrobbers and thieves, or any other gang of evil-doers could act at\nall if they injured one another? \n\nNo indeed, he said, they could not. \nBut if they abstained from injuring one another, then they might act\ntogether better? \n\nYes. \nAnd this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting,\nand justice imparts harmony and friendship; is not that true, Thrasymachus?\n\nI agree, he said, because I do not wish to quarrel with you.\n\nHow good of you, I said; but I should like to know also whether injustice,\nhaving this tendency to arouse hatred, wherever existing, among slaves\nor among freemen, will not make them hate one another and set them\nat variance and render them incapable of common action? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd even if injustice be found in two only, will they not quarrel\nand fight, and become enemies to one another and to the just\n\nThey will. \nAnd suppose injustice abiding in a single person, would your wisdom\nsay that she loses or that she retains her natural power?\n\nLet us assume that she retains her power. \nYet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that\nwherever she takes up her abode, whether in a city, in an army, in\na family, or in any other body, that body is, to begin with, rendered\nincapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction;\nand does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that\nopposes it, and with the just? Is not this the case? \n\nYes, certainly. \nAnd is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person;\nin the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is\nnot at unity with himself, and in the second place making him an enemy\nto himself and the just? Is not that true, Thrasymachus?\n\nYes. \nAnd O my friend, I said, surely the gods are just? \nGranted that they are. \nBut if so, the unjust will be the enemy of the gods, and the just\nwill be their friend? \n\nFeast away in triumph, and take your fill of the argument; I will\nnot oppose you, lest I should displease the company. \n\nWell then, proceed with your answers, and let me have the remainder\nof my repast. For we have already shown that the just are clearly\nwiser and better and abler than the unjust, and that the unjust are\nincapable of common action; nay ing at more, that to speak as we did\nof men who are evil acting at any time vigorously together, is not\nstrictly true, for if they had been perfectly evil, they would have\nlaid hands upon one another; but it is evident that there must have\nbeen some remnant of justice in them, which enabled them to combine;\nif there had not been they would have injured one another as well\nas their victims; they were but half --villains in their enterprises;\nfor had they been whole villains, and utterly unjust, they would have\nbeen utterly incapable of action. That, as I believe, is the truth\nof the matter, and not what you said at first. But whether the just\nhave a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question\nwhich we also proposed to consider. I think that they have, and for\nthe reasons which to have given; but still I should like to examine\nfurther, for no light matter is at stake, nothing less than the rule\nof human life. \n\nProceed. \nI will proceed by asking a question: Would you not say that a horse\nhas some end? \n\nI should. \nAnd the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could\nnot be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any other thing?\n\nI do not understand, he said. \nLet me explain: Can you see, except with the eye? \nCertainly not. \nOr hear, except with the ear? \nNo. \nThese then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs?\n\nThey may. \nBut you can cut off a vine-branch with a dagger or with a chisel,\nand in many other ways? \n\nOf course. \nAnd yet not so well as with a pruning-hook made for the purpose?\n\nTrue. \nMay we not say that this is the end of a pruning-hook? \nWe may. \nThen now I think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning\nwhen I asked the question whether the end of anything would be that\nwhich could not be accomplished, or not so well accomplished, by any\nother thing? \n\nI understand your meaning, he said, and assent. \nAnd that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence? Need\nI ask again whether the eye has an end? \n\nIt has. \nAnd has not the eye an excellence? \nYes. \nAnd the ear has an end and an excellence also? \nTrue. \nAnd the same is true of all other things; they have each of them an\nend and a special excellence? \n\nThat is so. \nWell, and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their\nown proper excellence and have a defect instead? \n\nHow can they, he said, if they are blind and cannot see?\n\nYou mean to say, if they have lost their proper excellence, which\nis sight; but I have not arrived at that point yet. I would rather\nask the question more generally, and only enquire whether the things\nwhich fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence,\nand fall of fulfilling them by their own defect? \n\nCertainly, he replied. \nI might say the same of the ears; when deprived of their own proper\nexcellence they cannot fulfil their end? \n\nTrue. \nAnd the same observation will apply to all other things?\n\nI agree. \nWell; and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil? for\nexample, to superintend and command and deliberate and the like. Are\nnot these functions proper to the soul, and can they rightly be assigned\nto any other? \n\nTo no other. \nAnd is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul?\n\nAssuredly, he said. \nAnd has not the soul an excellence also? \nYes. \nAnd can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that\nexcellence? \n\nShe cannot. \nThen an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent,\nand the good soul a good ruler? \n\nYes, necessarily. \nAnd we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul, and\ninjustice the defect of the soul? \n\nThat has been admitted. \nThen the just soul and the just man will live well, and the unjust\nman will live ill? \n\nThat is what your argument proves. \nAnd he who lives well is blessed and happy, and he who lives ill the\nreverse of happy? \n\nCertainly. \nThen the just is happy, and the unjust miserable? \nSo be it. \nBut happiness and not misery is profitable. \nOf course. \nThen, my blessed Thrasymachus, injustice can never be more profitable\nthan justice. \n\nLet this, Socrates, he said, be your entertainment at the Bendidea.\n\nFor which I am indebted to you, I said, now that you have grown gentle\ntowards me and have left off scolding. Nevertheless, I have not been\nwell entertained; but that was my own fault and not yours. As an epicure\nsnatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table,\nhe not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before, so have\nI gone from one subject to another without having discovered what\nI sought at first, the nature of justice. I left that enquiry and\nturned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil\nand folly; and when there arose a further question about the comparative\nadvantages of justice and injustice, I could not refrain from passing\non to that. And the result of the whole discussion has been that I\nknow nothing at all. For I know not what justice is, and therefore\nI am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue, nor can\nI say whether the just man is happy or unhappy. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK II\n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nWith these words I was thinking that I had made an end of the discussion;\nbut the end, in truth, proved to be only a beginning. For Glaucon,\nwho is always the most pugnacious of men, was dissatisfied at Thrasymachus'\nretirement; he wanted to have the battle out. So he said to me: Socrates,\ndo you wish really to persuade us, or only to seem to have persuaded\nus, that to be just is always better than to be unjust? \n\nI should wish really to persuade you, I replied, if I could.\n\nThen you certainly have not succeeded. Let me ask you now: --How would\nyou arrange goods --are there not some which we welcome for their\nown sakes, and independently of their consequences, as, for example,\nharmless pleasures and enjoyments, which delight us at the time, although\nnothing follows from them? \n\nI agree in thinking that there is such a class, I replied.\n\nIs there not also a second class of goods, such as knowledge, sight,\nhealth, which are desirable not only in themselves, but also for their\nresults? \n\nCertainly, I said. \nAnd would you not recognize a third class, such as gymnastic, and\nthe care of the sick, and the physician's art; also the various ways\nof money-making --these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable;\nand no one would choose them for their own sakes, but only for the\nsake of some reward or result which flows from them? \n\nThere is, I said, this third class also. But why do you ask?\n\nBecause I want to know in which of the three classes you would place\njustice? \n\nIn the highest class, I replied, --among those goods which he who\nwould be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of\ntheir results. \n\nThen the many are of another mind; they think that justice is to be\nreckoned in the troublesome class, among goods which are to be pursued\nfor the sake of rewards and of reputation, but in themselves are disagreeable\nand rather to be avoided. \n\nI know, I said, that this is their manner of thinking, and that this\nwas the thesis which Thrasymachus was maintaining just now, when he\ncensured justice and praised injustice. But I am too stupid to be\nconvinced by him. \n\nI wish, he said, that you would hear me as well as him, and then I\nshall see whether you and I agree. For Thrasymachus seems to me, like\na snake, to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to\nhave been; but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have\nnot yet been made clear. Setting aside their rewards and results,\nI want to know what they are in themselves, and how they inwardly\nwork in the soul. If you, please, then, I will revive the argument\nof Thrasymachus. And first I will speak of the nature and origin of\njustice according to the common view of them. Secondly, I will show\nthat all men who practise justice do so against their will, of necessity,\nbut not as a good. And thirdly, I will argue that there is reason\nin this view, for the life of the unjust is after all better far than\nthe life of the just --if what they say is true, Socrates, since I\nmyself am not of their opinion. But still I acknowledge that I am\nperplexed when I hear the voices of Thrasymachus and myriads of others\ndinning in my ears; and, on the other hand, I have never yet heard\nthe superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a\nsatisfactory way. I want to hear justice praised in respect of itself;\nthen I shall be satisfied, and you are the person from whom I think\nthat I am most likely to hear this; and therefore I will praise the\nunjust life to the utmost of my power, and my manner of speaking will\nindicate the manner in which I desire to hear you too praising justice\nand censuring injustice. Will you say whether you approve of my proposal?\n\nIndeed I do; nor can I imagine any theme about which a man of sense\nwould oftener wish to converse. \n\nI am delighted, he replied, to hear you say so, and shall begin by\nspeaking, as I proposed, of the nature and origin of justice.\n\nGlaucon \n\nThey say that to do injustice is, by nature, good; to suffer injustice,\nevil; but that the evil is greater than the good. And so when men\nhave both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both,\nnot being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that\nthey had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there\narise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law\nis termed by them lawful and just. This they affirm to be the origin\nand nature of justice; --it is a mean or compromise, between the best\nof all, which is to do injustice and not be punished, and the worst\nof all, which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation;\nand justice, being at a middle point between the two, is tolerated\nnot as a good, but as the lesser evil, and honoured by reason of the\ninability of men to do injustice. For no man who is worthy to be called\na man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist;\nhe would be mad if he did. Such is the received account, Socrates,\nof the nature and origin of justice. \n\nNow that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because\nthey have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine\nsomething of this kind: having given both to the just and the unjust\npower to do what they will, let us watch and see whither desire will\nlead them; then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust\nman to be proceeding along the same road, following their interest,\nwhich all natures deem to be their good, and are only diverted into\nthe path of justice by the force of law. The liberty which we are\nsupposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such\na power as is said to have been possessed by Gyges the ancestor of\nCroesus the Lydian. According to the tradition, Gyges was a shepherd\nin the service of the king of Lydia; there was a great storm, and\nan earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was\nfeeding his flock. Amazed at the sight, he descended into the opening,\nwhere, among other marvels, he beheld a hollow brazen horse, having\ndoors, at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature,\nas appeared to him, more than human, and having nothing on but a gold\nring; this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended. Now\nthe shepherds met together, according to custom, that they might send\ntheir monthly report about the flocks to the king; into their assembly\nhe came having the ring on his finger, and as he was sitting among\nthem he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand, when\ninstantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they\nbegan to speak of him as if he were no longer present. He was astonished\nat this, and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards\nand reappeared; he made several trials of the ring, and always with\nthe same result-when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible,\nwhen outwards he reappeared. Whereupon he contrived to be chosen one\nof the messengers who were sent to the court; where as soon as he\narrived he seduced the queen, and with her help conspired against\nthe king and slew him, and took the kingdom. Suppose now that there\nwere two such magic rings, and the just put on one of them and the\nunjust the other;,no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature\nthat he would stand fast in justice. No man would keep his hands off\nwhat was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of\nthe market, or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure,\nor kill or release from prison whom he would, and in all respects\nbe like a God among men. Then the actions of the just would be as\nthe actions of the unjust; they would both come at last to the same\npoint. And this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man\nis just, not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good\nto him individually, but of necessity, for wherever any one thinks\nthat he can safely be unjust, there he is unjust. For all men believe\nin their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual\nthan justice, and he who argues as I have been supposing, will say\nthat they are right. If you could imagine any one obtaining this power\nof becoming invisible, and never doing any wrong or touching what\nwas another's, he would be thought by the lookers-on to be a most\nwretched idiot, although they would praise him to one another's faces,\nand keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too\nmight suffer injustice. Enough of this. \n\nNow, if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and\nunjust, we must isolate them; there is no other way; and how is the\nisolation to be effected? I answer: Let the unjust man be entirely\nunjust, and the just man entirely just; nothing is to be taken away\nfrom either of them, and both are to be perfectly furnished for the\nwork of their respective lives. First, let the unjust be like other\ndistinguished masters of craft; like the skilful pilot or physician,\nwho knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits,\nand who, if he fails at any point, is able to recover himself. So\nlet the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way, and lie\nhidden if he means to be great in his injustice (he who is found out\nis nobody): for the highest reach of injustice is: to be deemed just\nwhen you are not. Therefore I say that in the perfectly unjust man\nwe must assume the most perfect injustice; there is to be no deduction,\nbut we must allow him, while doing the most unjust acts, to have acquired\nthe greatest reputation for justice. If he have taken a false step\nhe must be able to recover himself; he must be one who can speak with\neffect, if any of his deeds come to light, and who can force his way\nwhere force is required his courage and strength, and command of money\nand friends. And at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness\nand simplicity, wishing, as Aeschylus says, to be and not to seem\ngood. There must be no seeming, for if he seem to be just he will\nbe honoured and rewarded, and then we shall not know whether he is\njust for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards;\ntherefore, let him be clothed in justice only, and have no other covering;\nand he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former.\nLet him be the best of men, and let him be thought the worst; then\nhe will have been put to the proof; and we shall see whether he will\nbe affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences. And let him\ncontinue thus to the hour of death; being just and seeming to be unjust.\nWhen both have reached the uttermost extreme, the one of justice and\nthe other of injustice, let judgment be given which of them is the\nhappier of the two. \n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nHeavens! my dear Glaucon, I said, how energetically you polish them\nup for the decision, first one and then the other, as if they were\ntwo statues. \n\nI do my best, he said. And now that we know what they are like there\nis no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either\nof them. This I will proceed to describe; but as you may think the\ndescription a little too coarse, I ask you to suppose, Socrates, that\nthe words which follow are not mine. --Let me put them into the mouths\nof the eulogists of injustice: They will tell you that the just man\nwho is thought unjust will be scourged, racked, bound --will have\nhis eyes burnt out; and, at last, after suffering every kind of evil,\nhe will be impaled: Then he will understand that he ought to seem\nonly, and not to be, just; the words of Aeschylus may be more truly\nspoken of the unjust than of the just. For the unjust is pursuing\na reality; he does not live with a view to appearances --he wants\nto be really unjust and not to seem only:-- \n\nHis mind has a soil deep and fertile, \nOut of which spring his prudent counsels. In the first place, he is\nthought just, and therefore bears rule in the city; he can marry whom\nhe will, and give in marriage to whom he will; also he can trade and\ndeal where he likes, and always to his own advantage, because he has\nno misgivings about injustice and at every contest, whether in public\nor private, he gets the better of his antagonists, and gains at their\nexpense, and is rich, and out of his gains he can benefit his friends,\nand harm his enemies; moreover, he can offer sacrifices, and dedicate\ngifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently, and can honour the\ngods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than\nthe just, and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to\nthe gods. And thus, Socrates, gods and men are said to unite in making\nthe life of the unjust better than the life of the just.\n\nAdeimantus -SOCRATES \n\nI was going to say something in answer to Glaucon, when Adeimantus,\nhis brother, interposed: Socrates, he said, you do not suppose that\nthere is nothing more to be urged? \n\nWhy, what else is there? I answered. \nThe strongest point of all has not been even mentioned, he replied.\n\nWell, then, according to the proverb, 'Let brother help brother' --if\nhe fails in any part do you assist him; although I must confess that\nGlaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust, and take\nfrom me the power of helping justice. \n\nAdeimantus \n\nNonsense, he replied. But let me add something more: There is another\nside to Glaucon's argument about the praise and censure of justice\nand injustice, which is equally required in order to bring out what\nI believe to be his meaning. Parents and tutors are always telling\ntheir sons and their wards that they are to be just; but why? not\nfor the sake of justice, but for the sake of character and reputation;\nin the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those\noffices, marriages, and the like which Glaucon has enumerated among\nthe advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice.\nMore, however, is made of appearances by this class of persons than\nby the others; for they throw in the good opinion of the gods, and\nwill tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens, as they say,\nrain upon the pious; and this accords with the testimony of the noble\nHesiod and Homer, the first of whom says, that the gods make the oaks\nof the just-- \n\nTo hear acorns at their summit, and bees I the middle; \nAnd the sheep the bowed down bowed the with the their fleeces. and\nmany other blessings of a like kind are provided for them. And Homer\nhas a very similar strain; for he speaks of one whose fame is--\n\nAs the fame of some blameless king who, like a god, \nMaintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth \nWheat and barley, whose trees are bowed with fruit, \nAnd his sheep never fail to bear, and the sea gives him fish. Still\ngrander are the gifts of heaven which Musaeus and his son vouchsafe\nto the just; they take them down into the world below, where they\nhave the saints lying on couches at a feast, everlastingly drunk,\ncrowned with garlands; their idea seems to be that an immortality\nof drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue. Some extend their rewards\nyet further; the posterity, as they say, of the faithful and just\nshall survive to the third and fourth generation. This is the style\nin which they praise justice. But about the wicked there is another\nstrain; they bury them in a slough in Hades, and make them carry water\nin a sieve; also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy,\nand inflict upon them the punishments which Glaucon described as the\nportion of the just who are reputed to be unjust; nothing else does\ntheir invention supply. Such is their manner of praising the one and\ncensuring the other. \n\nOnce more, Socrates, I will ask you to consider another way of speaking\nabout justice and injustice, which is not confined to the poets, but\nis found in prose writers. The universal voice of mankind is always\ndeclaring that justice and virtue are honourable, but grievous and\ntoilsome; and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of\nattainment, and are only censured by law and opinion. They say also\nthat honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty;\nand they are quite ready to call wicked men happy, and to honour them\nboth in public and private when they are rich or in any other way\ninfluential, while they despise and overlook those who may be weak\nand poor, even though acknowledging them to be better than the others.\nBut most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue\nand the gods: they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery\nto many good men, and good and happiness to the wicked. And mendicant\nprophets go to rich men's doors and persuade them that they have a\npower committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man's\nown or his ancestor's sins by sacrifices or charms, with rejoicings\nand feasts; and they promise to harm an enemy, whether just or unjust,\nat a small cost; with magic arts and incantations binding heaven,\nas they say, to execute their will. And the poets are the authorities\nto whom they appeal, now smoothing the path of vice with the words\nof Hesiod; -- \n\nVice may be had in abundance without trouble; the way is smooth and\nher dwelling-place is near. But before virtue the gods have set toil,\nand a tedious and uphill road: then citing Homer as a witness that\nthe gods may be influenced by men; for he also says: \n\nThe gods, too, may he turned from their purpose; and men pray to them\nand avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties, and by\nlibations and the odour of fat, when they have sinned and transgressed.\nAnd they produce a host of books written by Musaeus and Orpheus, who\nwere children of the Moon and the Muses --that is what they say --according\nto which they perform their ritual, and persuade not only individuals,\nbut whole cities, that expiations and atonements for sin may be made\nby sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour, and are equally\nat the service of the living and the dead; the latter sort they call\nmysteries, and they redeem us from the pains of hell, but if we neglect\nthem no one knows what awaits us. \n\nHe proceeded: And now when the young hear all this said about virtue\nand vice, and the way in which gods and men regard them, how are their\nminds likely to be affected, my dear Socrates, --those of them, I\nmean, who are quickwitted, and, like bees on the wing, light on every\nflower, and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions\nas to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should\nwalk if they would make the best of life? Probably the youth will\nsay to himself in the words of Pindar-- \n\nCan I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower\nwhich may he a fortress to me all my days? For what men say is that,\nif I am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none,\nbut the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakable. But if,\nthough unjust, I acquire the reputation of justice, a heavenly life\nis promised to me. Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes\nover truth and is lord of happiness, to appearance I must devote myself.\nI will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the\nvestibule and exterior of my house; behind I will trail the subtle\nand crafty fox, as Archilochus, greatest of sages, recommends. But\nI hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often\ndifficult; to which I answer, Nothing great is easy. Nevertheless,\nthe argument indicates this, if we would be happy, to be the path\nalong which we should proceed. With a view to concealment we will\nestablish secret brotherhoods and political clubs. And there are professors\nof rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies;\nand so, partly by persuasion and partly by force, I shall make unlawful\ngains and not be punished. Still I hear a voice saying that the gods\ncannot be deceived, neither can they be compelled. But what if there\nare no gods? or, suppose them to have no care of human things --why\nin either case should we mind about concealment? And even if there\nare gods, and they do care about us, yet we know of them only from\ntradition and the genealogies of the poets; and these are the very\npersons who say that they may be influenced and turned by 'sacrifices\nand soothing entreaties and by offerings.' Let us be consistent then,\nand believe both or neither. If the poets speak truly, why then we\nhad better be unjust, and offer of the fruits of injustice; for if\nwe are just, although we may escape the vengeance of heaven, we shall\nlose the gains of injustice; but, if we are unjust, we shall keep\nthe gains, and by our sinning and praying, and praying and sinning,\nthe gods will be propitiated, and we shall not be punished. 'But there\nis a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for\nour unjust deeds.' Yes, my friend, will be the reflection, but there\nare mysteries and atoning deities, and these have great power. That\nis what mighty cities declare; and the children of the gods, who were\ntheir poets and prophets, bear a like testimony. \n\nOn what principle, then, shall we any longer choose justice rather\nthan the worst injustice? when, if we only unite the latter with a\ndeceitful regard to appearances, we shall fare to our mind both with\ngods and men, in life and after death, as the most numerous and the\nhighest authorities tell us. Knowing all this, Socrates, how can a\nman who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth, be\nwilling to honour justice; or indeed to refrain from laughing when\nhe hears justice praised? And even if there should be some one who\nis able to disprove the truth of my words, and who is satisfied that\njustice is best, still he is not angry with the unjust, but is very\nready to forgive them, because he also knows that men are not just\nof their own free will; unless, peradventure, there be some one whom\nthe divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice,\nor who has attained knowledge of the truth --but no other man. He\nonly blames injustice who, owing to cowardice or age or some weakness,\nhas not the power of being unjust. And this is proved by the fact\nthat when he obtains the power, he immediately becomes unjust as far\nas he can be. \n\nThe cause of all this, Socrates, was indicated by us at the beginning\nof the argument, when my brother and I told you how astonished we\nwere to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice --beginning\nwith the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to\nus, and ending with the men of our own time --no one has ever blamed\ninjustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories, honours,\nand benefits which flow from them. No one has ever adequately described\neither in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them\nabiding in the soul, and invisible to any human or divine eye; or\nshown that of all the things of a man's soul which he has within him,\njustice is the greatest good, and injustice the greatest evil. Had\nthis been the universal strain, had you sought to persuade us of this\nfrom our youth upwards, we should not have been on the watch to keep\none another from doing wrong, but every one would have been his own\nwatchman, because afraid, if he did wrong, of harbouring in himself\nthe greatest of evils. I dare say that Thrasymachus and others would\nseriously hold the language which I have been merely repeating, and\nwords even stronger than these about justice and injustice, grossly,\nas I conceive, perverting their true nature. But I speak in this vehement\nmanner, as I must frankly confess to you, because I want to hear from\nyou the opposite side; and I would ask you to show not only the superiority\nwhich justice has over injustice, but what effect they have on the\npossessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an\nevil to him. And please, as Glaucon requested of you, to exclude reputations;\nfor unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and\nadd on the false, we shall say that you do not praise justice, but\nthe appearance of it; we shall think that you are only exhorting us\nto keep injustice dark, and that you really agree with Thrasymachus\nin thinking that justice is another's good and the interest of the\nstronger, and that injustice is a man's own profit and interest, though\ninjurious to the weaker. Now as you have admitted that justice is\none of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their\nresults, but in a far greater degree for their own sakes --like sight\nor hearing or knowledge or health, or any other real and natural and\nnot merely conventional good --I would ask you in your praise of justice\nto regard one point only: I mean the essential good and evil which\njustice and injustice work in the possessors of them. Let others praise\njustice and censure injustice, magnifying the rewards and honours\nof the one and abusing the other; that is a manner of arguing which,\ncoming from them, I am ready to tolerate, but from you who have spent\nyour whole life in the consideration of this question, unless I hear\nthe contrary from your own lips, I expect something better. And therefore,\nI say, not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice,\nbut show what they either of them do to the possessor of them, which\nmakes the one to be a good and the other an evil, whether seen or\nunseen by gods and men. \n\nSocrates - ADEIMANTUS \n\nI had always admired the genius of Glaucon and Adeimantus, but on\nhearing these words I was quite delighted, and said: Sons of an illustrious\nfather, that was not a bad beginning of the Elegiac verses which the\nadmirer of Glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished\nyourselves at the battle of Megara:-- \n\n'Sons of Ariston,' he sang, 'divine offspring of an illustrious hero.'\nThe epithet is very appropriate, for there is something truly divine\nin being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice,\nand remaining unconvinced by your own arguments. And I do believe\nthat you are not convinced --this I infer from your general character,\nfor had I judged only from your speeches I should have mistrusted\nyou. But now, the greater my confidence in you, the greater is my\ndifficulty in knowing what to say. For I am in a strait between two;\non the one hand I feel that I am unequal to the task; and my inability\nis brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with\nthe answer which I made to Thrasymachus, proving, as I thought, the\nsuperiority which justice has over injustice. And yet I cannot refuse\nto help, while breath and speech remain to me; I am afraid that there\nwould be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of\nand not lifting up a hand in her defence. And therefore I had best\ngive such help as I can. \n\nGlaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question\ndrop, but to proceed in the investigation. They wanted to arrive at\nthe truth, first, about the nature of justice and injustice, and secondly,\nabout their relative advantages. I told them, what I --really thought,\nthat the enquiry would be of a serious nature, and would require very\ngood eyes. Seeing then, I said, that we are no great wits, I think\nthat we had better adopt a method which I may illustrate thus; suppose\nthat a short-sighted person had been asked by some one to read small\nletters from a distance; and it occurred to some one else that they\nmight be found in another place which was larger and in which the\nletters were larger --if they were the same and he could read the\nlarger letters first, and then proceed to the lesser --this would\nhave been thought a rare piece of good fortune. \n\nVery true, said Adeimantus; but how does the illustration apply to\nour enquiry? \n\nI will tell you, I replied; justice, which is the subject of our enquiry,\nis, as you know, sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual,\nand sometimes as the virtue of a State. \n\nTrue, he replied. \nAnd is not a State larger than an individual? \nIt is. \nThen in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger\nand more easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into\nthe nature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State,\nand secondly in the individual, proceeding from the greater to the\nlesser and comparing them. \n\nThat, he said, is an excellent proposal. \nAnd if we imagine the State in process of creation, we shall see the\njustice and injustice of the State in process of creation also.\n\nI dare say. \nWhen the State is completed there may be a hope that the object of\nour search will be more easily discovered. \n\nYes, far more easily. \nBut ought we to attempt to construct one? I said; for to do so, as\nI am inclined to think, will be a very serious task. Reflect therefore.\n\nI have reflected, said Adeimantus, and am anxious that you should\nproceed. \n\nA State, I said, arises, as I conceive, out of the needs of mankind;\nno one is self-sufficing, but all of us have many wants. Can any other\norigin of a State be imagined? \n\nThere can I be no other. \nThen, as we have many wants, and many persons are needed to supply\nthem, one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another;\nand when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation\nthe body of inhabitants is termed a State. \n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd they exchange with one another, and one gives, and another receives,\nunder the idea that the exchange will be for their good.\n\nVery true. \nThen, I said, let us begin and create in idea a State; and yet the\ntrue creator is necessity, who is the mother of our invention.\n\nOf course, he replied. \nNow the first and greatest of necessities is food, which is the condition\nof life and existence. \n\nCertainly. \nThe second is a dwelling, and the third clothing and the like.\n\nTrue. \nAnd now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great\ndemand: We may suppose that one man is a husbandman, another a builder,\nsome one else a weaver --shall we add to them a shoemaker, or perhaps\nsome other purveyor to our bodily wants? \n\nQuite right. \nThe barest notion of a State must include four or five men.\n\nClearly. \nAnd how will they proceed? Will each bring the result of his labours\ninto a common stock? --the individual husbandman, for example, producing\nfor four, and labouring four times as long and as much as he need\nin the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as\nhimself; or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the\ntrouble of producing for them, but provide for himself alone a fourth\nof the food in a fourth of the time, and in the remaining three-fourths\nof his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes,\nhaving no partnership with others, but supplying himself all his own\nwants? \n\nAdeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not\nat producing everything. \n\nProbably, I replied, that would be the better way; and when I hear\nyou say this, I am myself reminded that we are not all alike; there\nare diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different\noccupations. \n\nVery true. \nAnd will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations,\nor when he has only one? \n\nWhen he has only one. \nFurther, there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done\nat the right time? \n\nNo doubt. \nFor business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business\nis at leisure; but the doer must follow up what he is doing, and make\nthe business his first object. \n\nHe must. \nAnd if so, we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully\nand easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which\nis natural to him and does it at the right time, and leaves other\nthings. \n\nUndoubtedly.. \nThen more than four citizens will be required; for the husbandman\nwill not make his own plough or mattock, or other implements of agriculture,\nif they are to be good for anything. Neither will the builder make\nhis tools --and he too needs many; and in like manner the weaver and\nshoemaker. \n\nTrue. \nThen carpenters, and smiths, and many other artisans, will be sharers\nin our little State, which is already beginning to grow?\n\nTrue. \nYet even if we add neatherds, shepherds, and other herdsmen, in order\nthat our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with, and builders as\nwell as husbandmen may have draught cattle, and curriers and weavers\nfleeces and hides, --still our State will not be very large.\n\nThat is true; yet neither will it be a very small State which contains\nall these. \n\nThen, again, there is the situation of the city --to find a place\nwhere nothing need be imported is well-nigh impossible. \n\nImpossible. \nThen there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required\nsupply from another city? \n\nThere must. \nBut if the trader goes empty-handed, having nothing which they require\nwho would supply his need, he will come back empty-handed.\n\nThat is certain. \nAnd therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for\nthemselves, but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate\nthose from whom their wants are supplied. \n\nVery true. \nThen more husbandmen and more artisans will be required?\n\nThey will. \nNot to mention the importers and exporters, who are called merchants?\n\nYes. \nThen we shall want merchants? \nWe shall. \nAnd if merchandise is to be carried over the sea, skilful sailors\nwill also be needed, and in considerable numbers? \n\nYes, in considerable numbers. \nThen, again, within the city, how will they exchange their productions?\nTo secure such an exchange was, as you will remember, one of our principal\nobjects when we formed them into a society and constituted a State.\n\nClearly they will buy and sell. \nThen they will need a market-place, and a money-token for purposes\nof exchange. \n\nCertainly. \nSuppose now that a husbandman, or an artisan, brings some production\nto market, and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange\nwith him, --is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market-place?\n\nNot at all; he will find people there who, seeing the want, undertake\nthe office of salesmen. In well-ordered States they are commonly those\nwho are the weakest in bodily strength, and therefore of little use\nfor any other purpose; their duty is to be in the market, and to give\nmoney in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take\nmoney from those who desire to buy. \n\nThis want, then, creates a class of retail-traders in our State. Is\nnot 'retailer' the term which is applied to those who sit in the market-place\nengaged in buying and selling, while those who wander from one city\nto another are called merchants? \n\nYes, he said. \nAnd there is another class of servants, who are intellectually hardly\non the level of companionship; still they have plenty of bodily strength\nfor labour, which accordingly they sell, and are called, if I do not\nmistake, hirelings, hire being the name which is given to the price\nof their labour. \n\nTrue. \nThen hirelings will help to make up our population? \nYes. \nAnd now, Adeimantus, is our State matured and perfected?\n\nI think so. \nWhere, then, is justice, and where is injustice, and in what part\nof the State did they spring up? \n\nProbably in the dealings of these citizens with one another. cannot\nimagine that they are more likely to be found anywhere else.\n\nI dare say that you are right in your suggestion, I said; we had better\nthink the matter out, and not shrink from the enquiry. \n\nLet us then consider, first of all, what will be their way of life,\nnow that we have thus established them. Will they not produce corn,\nand wine, and clothes, and shoes, and build houses for themselves?\nAnd when they are housed, they will work, in summer, commonly, stripped\nand barefoot, but in winter substantially clothed and shod. They will\nfeed on barley-meal and flour of wheat, baking and kneading them,\nmaking noble cakes and loaves; these they will serve up on a mat of\nreeds or on clean leaves, themselves reclining the while upon beds\nstrewn with yew or myrtle. And they and their children will feast,\ndrinking of the wine which they have made, wearing garlands on their\nheads, and hymning the praises of the gods, in happy converse with\none another. And they will take care that their families do not exceed\ntheir means; having an eye to poverty or war. \n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nBut, said Glaucon, interposing, you have not given them a relish to\ntheir meal. \n\nTrue, I replied, I had forgotten; of course they must have a relish-salt,\nand olives, and cheese, and they will boil roots and herbs such as\ncountry people prepare; for a dessert we shall give them figs, and\npeas, and beans; and they will roast myrtle-berries and acorns at\nthe fire, drinking in moderation. And with such a diet they may be\nexpected to live in peace and health to a good old age, and bequeath\na similar life to their children after them. \n\nYes, Socrates, he said, and if you were providing for a city of pigs,\nhow else would you feed the beasts? \n\nBut what would you have, Glaucon? I replied. \nWhy, he said, you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life.\nPeople who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas, and\ndine off tables, and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern\nstyle. \n\nYes, I said, now I understand: the question which you would have me\nconsider is, not only how a State, but how a luxurious State is created;\nand possibly there is no harm in this, for in such a State we shall\nbe more likely to see how justice and injustice originate. In my opinion\nthe true and healthy constitution of the State is the one which I\nhave described. But if you wish also to see a State at fever heat,\nI have no objection. For I suspect that many will not be satisfied\nwith the simpler way of way They will be for adding sofas, and tables,\nand other furniture; also dainties, and perfumes, and incense, and\ncourtesans, and cakes, all these not of one sort only, but in every\nvariety; we must go beyond the necessaries of which I was at first\nspeaking, such as houses, and clothes, and shoes: the arts of the\npainter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion, and gold\nand ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured. \n\nTrue, he said. \nThen we must enlarge our borders; for the original healthy State is\nno longer sufficient. Now will the city have to fill and swell with\na multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want;\nsuch as the whole tribe of hunters and actors, of whom one large class\nhave to do with forms and colours; another will be the votaries of\nmusic --poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists, players, dancers,\ncontractors; also makers of divers kinds of articles, including women's\ndresses. And we shall want more servants. Will not tutors be also\nin request, and nurses wet and dry, tirewomen and barbers, as well\nas confectioners and cooks; and swineherds, too, who were not needed\nand therefore had no place in the former edition of our State, but\nare needed now? They must not be forgotten: and there will be animals\nof many other kinds, if people eat them. \n\nCertainly. \nAnd living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians\nthan before? \n\nMuch greater. \nAnd the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants\nwill be too small now, and not enough? \n\nQuite true. \nThen a slice of our neighbours' land will be wanted by us for pasture\nand tillage, and they will want a slice of ours, if, like ourselves,\nthey exceed the limit of necessity, and give themselves up to the\nunlimited accumulation of wealth? \n\nThat, Socrates, will be inevitable. \nAnd so we shall go to war, Glaucon. Shall we not? \nMost certainly, he replied. \nThen without determining as yet whether war does good or harm, thus\nmuch we may affirm, that now we have discovered war to be derived\nfrom causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in States,\nprivate as well as public. \n\nUndoubtedly. \nAnd our State must once more enlarge; and this time the will be nothing\nshort of a whole army, which will have to go out and fight with the\ninvaders for all that we have, as well as for the things and persons\nwhom we were describing above. \n\nWhy? he said; are they not capable of defending themselves?\n\nNo, I said; not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged\nby all of us when we were framing the State: the principle, as you\nwill remember, was that one man cannot practise many arts with success.\n\nVery true, he said. \nBut is not war an art? \nCertainly. \nAnd an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking? \nQuite true. \nAnd the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be husbandman, or a weaver,\na builder --in order that we might have our shoes well made; but to\nhim and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was\nby nature fitted, and at that he was to continue working all his life\nlong and at no other; he was not to let opportunities slip, and then\nhe would become a good workman. Now nothing can be more important\nthan that the work of a soldier should be well done. But is war an\nart so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman,\nor shoemaker, or other artisan; although no one in the world would\nbe a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a\nrecreation, and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to\nthis and nothing else? \n\nNo tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence,\nnor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and\nhas never bestowed any attention upon them. How then will he who takes\nup a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in\na day, whether with heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?\n\nYes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would\nbe beyond price. \n\nAnd the higher the duties of the guardian, I said, the more time,\nand skill, and art, and application will be needed by him?\n\nNo doubt, he replied. \nWill he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?\n\nCertainly. \nThen it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted\nfor the task of guarding the city? \n\nIt will. \nAnd the selection will be no easy matter, I said; but we must be brave\nand do our best. \n\nWe must. \nIs not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding\nand watching? \n\nWhat do you mean? \nI mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake\nthe enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught\nhim, they have to fight with him. \n\nAll these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.\n\nWell, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog\nor any other animal? Have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable\nis spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature\nto be absolutely fearless and indomitable? \n\nI have. \nThen now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are\nrequired in the guardian. \n\nTrue. \nAnd also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?\n\nYes. \nBut are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another,\nand with everybody else? \n\nA difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied. \nWhereas, I said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and\ngentle to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without\nwaiting for their enemies to destroy them. \n\nTrue, he said. \nWhat is to be done then? I said; how shall we find a gentle nature\nwhich has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of\nthe other? \n\nTrue. \nHe will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two\nqualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible;\nand hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.\n\nI am afraid that what you say is true, he replied. \nHere feeling perplexed I began to think over what had preceded. My\nfriend, I said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have\nlost sight of the image which we had before us. \n\nWhat do you mean? he said. \nI mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite\nqualities. \n\nAnd where do you find them? \nMany animals, I replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the\ndog is a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly\ngentle to their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.\n\nYes, I know. \nThen there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in\nour finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?\n\nCertainly not. \nWould not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited\nnature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher? \n\nI do not apprehend your meaning. \nThe trait of which I am speaking, I replied, may be also seen in the\ndog, and is remarkable in the animal. \n\nWhat trait? \nWhy, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance,\nhe welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor\nthe other any good. Did this never strike you as curious?\n\nThe matter never struck me before; but I quite recognise the truth\nof your remark. \n\nAnd surely this instinct of the dog is very charming; --your dog is\na true philosopher. \n\nWhy? \nWhy, because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy\nonly by the criterion of knowing and not knowing. And must not an\nanimal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes\nby the test of knowledge and ignorance? \n\nMost assuredly. \nAnd is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?\n\nThey are the same, he replied. \nAnd may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely\nto be gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a\nlover of wisdom and knowledge? \n\nThat we may safely affirm. \nThen he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the State\nwill require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness\nand strength? \n\nUndoubtedly. \nThen we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found\nthem, how are they to be reared and educated? Is not this enquiry\nwhich may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which\nis our final end --How do justice and injustice grow up in States?\nfor we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw\nout the argument to an inconvenient length. \n\nSocrates - ADEIMANTUS \n\nAdeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.\n\nThen, I said, my dear friend, the task must not be given up, even\nif somewhat long. \n\nCertainly not. \nCome then, and let us pass a leisure hour in story-telling, and our\nstory shall be the education of our heroes. \n\nBy all means. \nAnd what shall be their education? Can we find a better than the traditional\nsort? --and this has two divisions, gymnastic for the body, and music\nfor the soul. \n\nTrue. \nShall we begin education with music, and go on to gymnastic afterwards?\n\nBy all means. \nAnd when you speak of music, do you include literature or not?\n\nI do. \nAnd literature may be either true or false? \nYes. \nAnd the young should be trained in both kinds, and we begin with the\nfalse? \n\nI do not understand your meaning, he said. \nYou know, I said, that we begin by telling children stories which,\nthough not wholly destitute of truth, are in the main fictitious;\nand these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn\ngymnastics. \n\nVery true. \nThat was my meaning when I said that we must teach music before gymnastics.\n\nQuite right, he said. \nYou know also that the beginning is the most important part of any\nwork, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that\nis the time at which the character is being formed and the desired\nimpression is more readily taken. \n\nQuite true. \nAnd shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales\nwhich may be devised by casual persons, and to receive into their\nminds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we\nshould wish them to have when they are grown up? \n\nWe cannot. \nThen the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers\nof fiction, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which\nis good, and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses\nto tell their children the authorised ones only. Let them fashion\nthe mind with such tales, even more fondly than they mould the body\nwith their hands; but most of those which are now in use must be discarded.\n\nOf what tales are you speaking? he said. \nYou may find a model of the lesser in the greater, I said; for they\nare necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in\nboth of them. \n\nVery likely, he replied; but I do not as yet know what you would term\nthe greater. \n\nThose, I said, which are narrated by Homer and Hesiod, and the rest\nof the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.\n\nBut which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find\nwith them? \n\nA fault which is most serious, I said; the fault of telling a lie,\nand, what is more, a bad lie. \n\nBut when is this fault committed? \nWhenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods\nand heroes, --as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow\nof a likeness to the original. \n\nYes, he said, that sort of thing is certainly very blamable; but what\nare the stories which you mean? \n\nFirst of all, I said, there was that greatest of all lies, in high\nplaces, which the poet told about Uranus, and which was a bad lie\ntoo, --I mean what Hesiod says that Uranus did, and how Cronus retaliated\non him. The doings of Cronus, and the sufferings which in turn his\nson inflicted upon him, even if they were true, ought certainly not\nto be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons; if possible,\nthey had better be buried in silence. But if there is an absolute\nnecessity for their mention, a chosen few might hear them in a mystery,\nand they should sacrifice not a common [Eleusinian] pig, but some\nhuge and unprocurable victim; and then the number of the hearers will\nbe very few indeed. \n\nWhy, yes, said he, those stories are extremely objectionable.\n\nYes, Adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our State;\nthe young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes\nhe is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises\nhis father when does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following\nthe example of the first and greatest among the gods. \n\nI entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are\nquite unfit to be repeated. \n\nNeither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling\namong themselves as of all things the basest, should any word be said\nto them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and fightings of the\ngods against one another, for they are not true. No, we shall never\nmention the battles of the giants, or let them be embroidered on garments;\nand we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods\nand heroes with their friends and relatives. If they would only believe\nus we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy, and that never up\nto this time has there been any, quarrel between citizens; this is\nwhat old men and old women should begin by telling children; and when\nthey grow up, the poets also should be told to compose for them in\na similar spirit. But the narrative of Hephaestus binding Here his\nmother, or how on another occasion Zeus sent him flying for taking\nher part when she was being beaten, and all the battles of the gods\nin Homer --these tales must not be admitted into our State, whether\nthey are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. For a young\nperson cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal; anything\nthat he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible\nand unalterable; and therefore it is most important that the tales\nwhich the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts.\n\nThere you are right, he replied; but if any one asks where are such\nmodels to be found and of what tales are you speaking --how shall\nwe answer him? \n\nI said to him, You and I, Adeimantus, at this moment are not poets,\nbut founders of a State: now the founders of a State ought to know\nthe general forms in which poets should cast their tales, and the\nlimits which must be observed by them, but to make the tales is not\ntheir business. \n\nVery true, he said; but what are these forms of theology which you\nmean? \n\nSomething of this kind, I replied: --God is always to be represented\nas he truly is, whatever be the sort of poetry, epic, lyric or tragic,\nin which the representation is given. \n\nRight. \nAnd is he not truly good? and must he not be represented as such?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd no good thing is hurtful? \nNo, indeed. \nAnd that which is not hurtful hurts not? \nCertainly not. \nAnd that which hurts not does no evil? \nNo. \nAnd can that which does no evil be a cause of evil? \nImpossible. \nAnd the good is advantageous? \nYes. \nAnd therefore the cause of well-being? \nYes. \nIt follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things,\nbut of the good only? \n\nAssuredly. \nThen God, if he be good, is not the author of all things, as the many\nassert, but he is the cause of a few things only, and not of most\nthings that occur to men. For few are the goods of human life, and\nmany are the evils, and the good is to be attributed to God alone;\nof the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere, and not in him.\n\nThat appears to me to be most true, he said. \nThen we must not listen to Homer or to any other poet who is guilty\nof the folly of saying that two casks Lie at the threshold of Zeus,\nfull of lots, one of good, the other of evil lots, and that he to\nwhom Zeus gives a mixture of the two Sometimes meets with evil fortune,\nat other times with good; but that he to whom is given the cup of\nunmingled ill, \n\nHim wild hunger drives o'er the beauteous earth. And again\n\nZeus, who is the dispenser of good and evil to us. And if any one\nasserts that the violation of oaths and treaties, which was really\nthe work of Pandarus, was brought about by Athene and Zeus, or that\nthe strife and contention of the gods was instigated by Themis and\nZeus, he shall not have our approval; neither will we allow our young\nmen to hear the words of Aeschylus, that God plants guilt among men\nwhen he desires utterly to destroy a house. And if a poet writes of\nthe sufferings of Niobe --the subject of the tragedy in which these\niambic verses occur --or of the house of Pelops, or of the Trojan\nwar or on any similar theme, either we must not permit him to say\nthat these are the works of God, or if they are of God, he must devise\nsome explanation of them such as we are seeking; he must say that\nGod did what was just and right, and they were the better for being\npunished; but that those who are punished are miserable, and that\nGod is the author of their misery --the poet is not to be permitted\nto say; though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they\nrequire to be punished, and are benefited by receiving punishment\nfrom God; but that God being good is the author of evil to any one\nis to be strenuously denied, and not to be said or sung or heard in\nverse or prose by any one whether old or young in any well-ordered\ncommonwealth. Such a fiction is suicidal, ruinous, impious.\n\nI agree with you, he replied, and am ready to give my assent to the\nlaw. \n\nLet this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods,\nto which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform --that\nGod is not the author of all things, but of good only. \n\nThat will do, he said. \nAnd what do you think of a second principle? Shall I ask you whether\nGod is a magician, and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one\nshape, and now in another --sometimes himself changing and passing\ninto many forms, sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such\ntransformations; or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his\nown proper image? \n\nI cannot answer you, he said, without more thought. \nWell, I said; but if we suppose a change in anything, that change\nmust be effected either by the thing itself, or by some other thing?\n\nMost certainly. \nAnd things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered\nor discomposed; for example, when healthiest and strongest, the human\nframe is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks, and the\nplant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds\nor the heat of the sun or any similar causes. \n\nOf course. \nAnd will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged\nby any external influence? \n\nTrue. \nAnd the same principle, as I should suppose, applies to all composite\nthings --furniture, houses, garments; when good and well made, they\nare least altered by time and circumstances. \n\nVery true. \nThen everything which is good, whether made by art or nature, or both,\nis least liable to suffer change from without? \n\nTrue. \nBut surely God and the things of God are in every way perfect?\n\nOf course they are. \nThen he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many\nshapes? \n\nHe cannot. \nBut may he not change and transform himself? \nClearly, he said, that must be the case if he is changed at all.\n\nAnd will he then change himself for the better and fairer, or for\nthe worse and more unsightly? \n\nIf he change at all he can only change for the worse, for we cannot\nsuppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty. \n\nVery true, Adeimantus; but then, would any one, whether God or man,\ndesire to make himself worse? \n\nImpossible. \nThen it is impossible that God should ever be willing to change; being,\nas is supposed, the fairest and best that is conceivable, every god\nremains absolutely and for ever in his own form. \n\nThat necessarily follows, he said, in my judgment. \nThen, I said, my dear friend, let none of the poets tell us that\n\nThe gods, taking the disguise of strangers from other lands, walk\nup and down cities in all sorts of forms; and let no one slander Proteus\nand Thetis, neither let any one, either in tragedy or in any other\nkind of poetry, introduce Here disguised in the likeness of a priestess\nasking an alms \n\nFor the life-giving daughters of Inachus the river of Argos; --let\nus have no more lies of that sort. Neither must we have mothers under\nthe influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version\nof these myths --telling how certain gods, as they say, 'Go about\nby night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms';\nbut let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children, and\nat the same time speak blasphemy against the gods. \n\nHeaven forbid, he said. \nBut although the gods are themselves unchangeable, still by witchcraft\nand deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms?\n\nPerhaps, he replied. \nWell, but can you imagine that God will be willing to lie, whether\nin word or deed, or to put forth a phantom of himself? \n\nI cannot say, he replied. \nDo you not know, I said, that the true lie, if such an expression\nmay be allowed, is hated of gods and men? \n\nWhat do you mean? he said. \nI mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest\nand highest part of himself, or about the truest and highest matters;\nthere, above all, he is most afraid of a lie having possession of\nhim. \n\nStill, he said, I do not comprehend you. \nThe reason is, I replied, that you attribute some profound meaning\nto my words; but I am only saying that deception, or being deceived\nor uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves,\nwhich is the soul, and in that part of them to have and to hold the\nlie, is what mankind least like; --that, I say, is what they utterly\ndetest. \n\nThere is nothing more hateful to them. \nAnd, as I was just now remarking, this ignorance in the soul of him\nwho is deceived may be called the true lie; for the lie in words is\nonly a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection\nof the soul, not pure unadulterated falsehood. Am I not right?\n\nPerfectly right. \nThe true lie is hated not only by the gods, but also by men?\n\nYes. \nWhereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful;\nin dealing with enemies --that would be an instance; or again, when\nthose whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are\ngoing to do some harm, then it is useful and is a sort of medicine\nor preventive; also in the tales of mythology, of which we were just\nnow speaking --because we do not know the truth about ancient times,\nwe make falsehood as much like truth as we can, and so turn it to\naccount. \n\nVery true, he said. \nBut can any of these reasons apply to God? Can we suppose that he\nis ignorant of antiquity, and therefore has recourse to invention?\n\nThat would be ridiculous, he said. \nThen the lying poet has no place in our idea of God? \nI should say not. \nOr perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies?\n\nThat is inconceivable. \nBut he may have friends who are senseless or mad? \nBut no mad or senseless person can be a friend of God. \nThen no motive can be imagined why God should lie? \nNone whatever. \nThen the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood?\n\nYes. \nThen is God perfectly simple and true both in word and deed; he changes\nnot; he deceives not, either by sign or word, by dream or waking vision.\n\nYour thoughts, he said, are the reflection of my own. \nYou agree with me then, I said, that this is the second type or form\nin which we should write and speak about divine things. The gods are\nnot magicians who transform themselves, neither do they deceive mankind\nin any way. \n\nI grant that. \nThen, although we are admirers of Homer, we do not admire the lying\ndream which Zeus sends to Agamemnon; neither will we praise the verses\nof Aeschylus in which Thetis says that Apollo at her nuptials\n\nWas celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to he long,\nand to know no sickness. And when he had spoken of my lot as in all\nthings blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my\nsoul. And I thought that the word of Phoebus being divine and full\nof prophecy, would not fail. And now he himself who uttered the strain,\nhe who was present at the banquet, and who said this --he it is who\nhas slain my son. \n\nThese are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse\nour anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither\nshall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of\nthe young, meaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can\nbe, should be true worshippers of the gods and like them.\n\nI entirely agree, be said, in these principles, and promise to make\nthem my laws. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK III\n\nSocrates - ADEIMANTUS \n\nSuch then, I said, are our principles of theology --some tales are\nto be told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their\nyouth upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents,\nand to value friendship with one another. \n\nYes; and I think that our principles are right, he said.\n\nBut if they are to be courageous, must they not learn other lessons\nbesides these, and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear\nof death? Can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him?\n\nCertainly not, he said. \nAnd can he be fearless of death, or will he choose death in battle\nrather than defeat and slavery, who believes the world below to be\nreal and terrible? \n\nImpossible. \nThen we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of\ntales as well as over the others, and beg them not simply to but rather\nto commend the world below, intimating to them that their descriptions\nare untrue, and will do harm to our future warriors. \n\nThat will be our duty, he said. \nThen, I said, we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages,\nbeginning with the verses, \n\nI would rather he a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man\nthan rule over all the dead who have come to nought. We must also\nexpunge the verse, which tells us how Pluto feared, \n\nLest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should he\nseen both of mortals and immortals. And again: \n\nO heavens! verily in the house of Hades there is soul and ghostly\nform but no mind at all! Again of Tiresias: -- \n\n[To him even after death did Persephone grant mind,] that he alone\nshould be wise; but the other souls are flitting shades. Again: --\n\nThe soul flying from the limbs had gone to Hades, lamentng her fate,\nleaving manhood and youth. Again: -- \n\nAnd the soul, with shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath the earth.\nAnd, -- \n\nAs bats in hollow of mystic cavern, whenever any of the has dropped\nout of the string and falls from the rock, fly shrilling and cling\nto one another, so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they\nmoved. And we must beg Homer and the other poets not to be angry if\nwe strike out these and similar passages, not because they are unpoetical,\nor unattractive to the popular ear, but because the greater the poetical\ncharm of them, the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men\nwho are meant to be free, and who should fear slavery more than death.\n\nUndoubtedly. \nAlso we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names\ndescribe the world below --Cocytus and Styx, ghosts under the earth,\nand sapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention\ncauses a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears\nthem. I do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use\nof some kind; but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians\nmay be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them. \n\nThere is a real danger, he said. \nThen we must have no more of them. \nTrue. \nAnother and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us.\n\nClearly. \nAnd shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous\nmen? \n\nThey will go with the rest. \nBut shall we be right in getting rid of them? Reflect: our principle\nis that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other\ngood man who is his comrade. \n\nYes; that is our principle. \nAnd therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though\nhe had suffered anything terrible? \n\nHe will not. \nSuch an one, as we further maintain, is sufficient for himself and\nhis own happiness, and therefore is least in need of other men.\n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd for this reason the loss of a son or brother, or the deprivation\nof fortune, is to him of all men least terrible. \n\nAssuredly. \nAnd therefore he will be least likely to lament, and will bear with\nthe greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall\nhim. \n\nYes, he will feel such a misfortune far less than another.\n\nThen we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous\nmen, and making them over to women (and not even to women who are\ngood for anything), or to men of a baser sort, that those who are\nbeing educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn\nto do the like. \n\nThat will be very right. \nThen we will once more entreat Homer and the other poets not to depict\nAchilles, who is the son of a goddess, first lying on his side, then\non his back, and then on his face; then starting up and sailing in\na frenzy along the shores of the barren sea; now taking the sooty\nashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head, or weeping\nand wailing in the various modes which Homer has delineated. Nor should\nhe describe Priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching,\n\nRolling in the dirt, calling each man loudly by his name. Still more\nearnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods\nlamenting and saying, \n\nAlas! my misery! Alas! that I bore the harvest to my sorrow. But if\nhe must introduce the gods, at any rate let him not dare so completely\nto misrepresent the greatest of the gods, as to make him say --\n\nO heavens! with my eyes verily I behold a dear friend of mine chased\nround and round the city, and my heart is sorrowful. Or again: --\n\nWoe is me that I am fated to have Sarpedon, dearest of men to me,\nsubdued at the hands of Patroclus the son of Menoetius. For if, my\nsweet Adeimantus, our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations\nof the gods, instead of laughing at them as they ought, hardly will\nany of them deem that he himself, being but a man, can be dishonoured\nby similar actions; neither will he rebuke any inclination which may\narise in his mind to say and do the like. And instead of having any\nshame or self-control, he will be always whining and lamenting on\nslight occasions. \n\nYes, he said, that is most true. \nYes, I replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the argument\nhas just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until it is\ndisproved by a better. \n\nIt ought not to be. \nNeither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. For a fit of\nlaughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces\na violent reaction. \n\nSo I believe. \nThen persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be represented\nas overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation\nof the gods be allowed. \n\nStill less of the gods, as you say, he replied. \nThen we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods\nas that of Homer when he describes how \n\nInextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods, when they\nsaw Hephaestus bustling about the mansion. On your views, we must\nnot admit them. \n\nOn my views, if you like to father them on me; that we must not admit\nthem is certain. \n\nAgain, truth should be highly valued; if, as we were saying, a lie\nis useless to the gods, and useful only as a medicine to men, then\nthe use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians; private\nindividuals have no business with them. \n\nClearly not, he said. \nThen if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers\nof the State should be the persons; and they, in their dealings either\nwith enemies or with their own citizens, may be allowed to lie for\nthe public good. But nobody else should meddle with anything of the\nkind; and although the rulers have this privilege, for a private man\nto lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than\nfor the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth\nabout his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer,\nor for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the\nship and the rest of the crew, and how things are going with himself\nor his fellow sailors. \n\nMost true, he said. \nIf, then, the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the State,\n\nAny of the craftsmen, whether he priest or physician or carpenter.\nhe will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive\nand destructive of ship or State. \n\nMost certainly, he said, if our idea of the State is ever carried\nout. \n\nIn the next place our youth must be temperate? \nCertainly. \nAre not the chief elements of temperance, speaking generally, obedience\nto commanders and self-control in sensual pleasures? \n\nTrue. \nThen we shall approve such language as that of Diomede in Homer,\n\nFriend, sit still and obey my word, and the verses which follow,\n\nThe Greeks marched breathing prowess, \n...in silent awe of their leaders, and other sentiments of the same\nkind. \n\nWe shall. \nWhat of this line, \n\nO heavy with wine, who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag,\nand of the words which follow? Would you say that these, or any similar\nimpertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to\ntheir rulers, whether in verse or prose, are well or ill spoken?\n\nThey are ill spoken. \nThey may very possibly afford some amusement, but they do not conduce\nto temperance. And therefore they are likely to do harm to our young\nmen --you would agree with me there? \n\nYes. \nAnd then, again, to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his\nopinion is more glorious than \n\nWhen the tables are full of bread and meat, and the cup-bearer carries\nround wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups, is\nit fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words?\nOr the verse \n\nThe saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger? What\nwould you say again to the tale of Zeus, who, while other gods and\nmen were asleep and he the only person awake, lay devising plans,\nbut forgot them all in a moment through his lust, and was so completely\novercome at the sight of Here that he would not even go into the hut,\nbut wanted to lie with her on the ground, declaring that he had never\nbeen in such a state of rapture before, even when they first met one\nanother \n\nWithout the knowledge of their parents; or that other tale of how\nHephaestus, because of similar goings on, cast a chain around Ares\nand Aphrodite? \n\nIndeed, he said, I am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear\nthat sort of thing. \n\nBut any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men, these\nthey ought to see and hear; as, for example, what is said in the verses,\n\nHe smote his breast, and thus reproached his heart, \nEndure, my heart; far worse hast thou endured! \n\nCertainly, he said. \nIn the next place, we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers\nof money. \n\nCertainly not. \nNeither must we sing to them of \n\nGifts persuading gods, and persuading reverend kings. Neither is Phoenix,\nthe tutor of Achilles, to be approved or deemed to have given his\npupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts\nof the Greeks and assist them; but that without a gift he should not\nlay aside his anger. Neither will we believe or acknowledge Achilles\nhimself to have been such a lover of money that he took Agamemnon's\nor that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of\nHector, but that without payment he was unwilling to do so.\n\nUndoubtedly, he said, these are not sentiments which can be approved.\n\nLoving Homer as I do, I hardly like to say that in attributing these\nfeelings to Achilles, or in believing that they are truly to him,\nhe is guilty of downright impiety. As little can I believe the narrative\nof his insolence to Apollo, where he says, \n\nThou hast wronged me, O far-darter, most abominable of deities. Verily\nI would he even with thee, if I had only the power, or his insubordination\nto the river-god, on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands; or his\noffering to the dead Patroclus of his own hair, which had been previously\ndedicated to the other river-god Spercheius, and that he actually\nperformed this vow; or that he dragged Hector round the tomb of Patroclus,\nand slaughtered the captives at the pyre; of all this I cannot believe\nthat he was guilty, any more than I can allow our citizens to believe\nthat he, the wise Cheiron's pupil, the son of a goddess and of Peleus\nwho was the gentlest of men and third in descent from Zeus, was so\ndisordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly\ninconsistent passions, meanness, not untainted by avarice, combined\nwith overweening contempt of gods and men. \n\nYou are quite right, he replied. \nAnd let us equally refuse to believe, or allow to be repeated, the\ntale of Theseus son of Poseidon, or of Peirithous son of Zeus, going\nforth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape; or of any other hero\nor son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they\nfalsely ascribe to them in our day: and let us further compel the\npoets to declare either that these acts were not done by them, or\nthat they were not the sons of gods; --both in the same breath they\nshall not be permitted to affirm. We will not have them trying to\npersuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil, and that\nheroes are no better than men-sentiments which, as we were saying,\nare neither pious nor true, for we have already proved that evil cannot\ncome from the gods. \n\nAssuredly not. \nAnd further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear\nthem; for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is\nconvinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by\n-- \n\nThe kindred of the gods, the relatives of Zeus, whose ancestral altar,\nthe attar of Zeus, is aloft in air on the peak of Ida, and who have\n\nthe blood of deities yet flowing in their veins. And therefore let\nus put an end to such tales, lest they engender laxity of morals among\nthe young. \n\nBy all means, he replied. \nBut now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are\nnot to be spoken of, let us see whether any have been omitted by us.\nThe manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below\nshould be treated has been already laid down. \n\nVery true. \nAnd what shall we say about men? That is clearly the remaining portion\nof our subject. \n\nClearly so. \nBut we are not in a condition to answer this question at present,\nmy friend. \n\nWhy not? \nBecause, if I am not mistaken, we shall have to say that about men\npoets and story-tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements\nwhen they tell us that wicked men are often happy, and the good miserable;\nand that injustice is profitable when undetected, but that justice\nis a man's own loss and another's gain --these things we shall forbid\nthem to utter, and command them to sing and say the opposite.\n\nTo be sure we shall, he replied. \nBut if you admit that I am right in this, then I shall maintain that\nyou have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending.\n\nI grant the truth of your inference. \nThat such things are or are not to be said about men is a question\nwhich we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is,\nand how naturally advantageous to the possessor, whether he seems\nto be just or not. \n\nMost true, he said. \nEnough of the subjects of poetry: let us now speak of the style; and\nwhen this has been considered, both matter and manner will have been\ncompletely treated. \n\nI do not understand what you mean, said Adeimantus. \nThen I must make you understand; and perhaps I may be more intelligible\nif I put the matter in this way. You are aware, I suppose, that all\nmythology and poetry is a narration of events, either past, present,\nor to come? \n\nCertainly, he replied. \nAnd narration may be either simple narration, or imitation, or a union\nof the two? \n\nThat again, he said, I do not quite understand. \nI fear that I must be a ridiculous teacher when I have so much difficulty\nin making myself apprehended. Like a bad speaker, therefore, I will\nnot take the whole of the subject, but will break a piece off in illustration\nof my meaning. You know the first lines of the Iliad, in which the\npoet says that Chryses prayed Agamemnon to release his daughter, and\nthat Agamemnon flew into a passion with him; whereupon Chryses, failing\nof his object, invoked the anger of the God against the Achaeans.\nNow as far as these lines, \n\nAnd he prayed all the Greeks, but especially the two sons of Atreus,\nthe chiefs of the people, the poet is speaking in his own person;\nhe never leads us to suppose that he is any one else. But in what\nfollows he takes the person of Chryses, and then he does all that\nhe can to make us believe that the speaker is not Homer, but the aged\npriest himself. And in this double form he has cast the entire narrative\nof the events which occurred at Troy and in Ithaca and throughout\nthe Odyssey. \n\nYes. \nAnd a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites\nfrom time to time and in the intermediate passages? \n\nQuite true. \nBut when the poet speaks in the person of another, may we not say\nthat he assimilates his style to that of the person who, as he informs\nyou, is going to speak? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd this assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of\nvoice or gesture, is the imitation of the person whose character he\nassumes? \n\nOf course. \nThen in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed\nby way of imitation? \n\nVery true. \nOr, if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself, then\nagain the imitation is dropped, and his poetry becomes simple narration.\nHowever, in order that I may make my meaning quite clear, and that\nyou may no more say, I don't understand,' I will show how the change\nmight be effected. If Homer had said, 'The priest came, having his\ndaughter's ransom in his hands, supplicating the Achaeans, and above\nall the kings;' and then if, instead of speaking in the person of\nChryses, he had continued in his own person, the words would have\nbeen, not imitation, but simple narration. The passage would have\nrun as follows (I am no poet, and therefore I drop the metre), 'The\npriest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the Greeks that they\nmight capture Troy and return safely home, but begged that they would\ngive him back his daughter, and take the ransom which he brought,\nand respect the God. Thus he spoke, and the other Greeks revered the\npriest and assented. But Agamemnon was wroth, and bade him depart\nand not come again, lest the staff and chaplets of the God should\nbe of no avail to him --the daughter of Chryses should not be released,\nhe said --she should grow old with him in Argos. And then he told\nhim to go away and not to provoke him, if he intended to get home\nunscathed. And the old man went away in fear and silence, and, when\nhe had left the camp, he called upon Apollo by his many names, reminding\nhim of everything which he had done pleasing to him, whether in building\nhis temples, or in offering sacrifice, and praying that his good deeds\nmight be returned to him, and that the Achaeans might expiate his\ntears by the arrows of the god,' --and so on. In this way the whole\nbecomes simple narrative. \n\nI understand, he said. \nOr you may suppose the opposite case --that the intermediate passages\nare omitted, and the dialogue only left. \n\nThat also, he said, I understand; you mean, for example, as in tragedy.\n\nYou have conceived my meaning perfectly; and if I mistake not, what\nyou failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you, that poetry\nand mythology are, in some cases, wholly imitative --instances of\nthis are supplied by tragedy and comedy; there is likewise the opposite\nstyle, in which the my poet is the only speaker --of this the dithyramb\naffords the best example; and the combination of both is found in\nepic, and in several other styles of poetry. Do I take you with me?\n\nYes, he said; I see now what you meant. \nI will ask you to remember also what I began by saying, that we had\ndone with the subject and might proceed to the style. \n\nYes, I remember. \nIn saying this, I intended to imply that we must come to an understanding\nabout the mimetic art, --whether the poets, in narrating their stories,\nare to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether in whole or\nin part, and if the latter, in what parts; or should all imitation\nbe prohibited? \n\nYou mean, I suspect, to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted\ninto our State? \n\nYes, I said; but there may be more than this in question: I really\ndo not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we\ngo. \n\nAnd go we will, he said. \nThen, Adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be\nimitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule\nalready laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not\nmany; and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fall of gaining\nmuch reputation in any? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many\nthings as well as he would imitate a single one? \n\nHe cannot. \nThen the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in\nlife, and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other\nparts as well; for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied,\nthe same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers\nof tragedy and comedy --did you not just now call them imitations?\n\nYes, I did; and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot\nsucceed in both. \n\nAny more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once?\n\nTrue. \nNeither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things\nare but imitations. \n\nThey are so. \nAnd human nature, Adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet\nsmaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well,\nas of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.\n\nQuite true, he replied. \nIf then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our\nguardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate themselves\nwholly to the maintenance of freedom in the State, making this their\ncraft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end, they\nought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they imitate at\nall, they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which\nare suitable to their profession --the courageous, temperate, holy,\nfree, and the like; but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating\nany kind of illiberality or baseness, lest from imitation they should\ncome to be what they imitate. Did you never observe how imitations,\nbeginning in early youth and continuing far into life, at length grow\ninto habits and become a second nature, affecting body, voice, and\nmind? \n\nYes, certainly, he said. \nThen, I said, we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and\nof whom we say that they ought to be good men, to imitate a woman,\nwhether young or old, quarrelling with her husband, or striving and\nvaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness, or when she\nis in affliction, or sorrow, or weeping; and certainly not one who\nis in sickness, love, or labour. \n\nVery right, he said. \nNeither must they represent slaves, male or female, performing the\noffices of slaves? \n\nThey must not. \nAnd surely not bad men, whether cowards or any others, who do the\nreverse of what we have just been prescribing, who scold or mock or\nrevile one another in drink or out of in drink or, or who in any other\nmanner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed,\nas the manner of such is. Neither should they be trained to imitate\nthe action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad; for madness,\nlike vice, is to be known but not to be practised or imitated.\n\nVery true, he replied. \nNeither may they imitate smiths or other artificers, or oarsmen, or\nboatswains, or the like? \n\nHow can they, he said, when they are not allowed to apply their minds\nto the callings of any of these? \n\nNor may they imitate the neighing of horses, the bellowing of bulls,\nthe murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean, thunder, and all that\nsort of thing? \n\nNay, he said, if madness be forbidden, neither may they copy the behaviour\nof madmen. \n\nYou mean, I said, if I understand you aright, that there is one sort\nof narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when\nhe has anything to say, and that another sort will be used by a man\nof an opposite character and education. \n\nAnd which are these two sorts? he asked. \nSuppose, I answered, that a just and good man in the course of a narration\ncomes on some saying or action of another good man, --I should imagine\nthat he will like to personate him, and will not be ashamed of this\nsort of imitation: he will be most ready to play the part of the good\nman when he is acting firmly and wisely; in a less degree when he\nis overtaken by illness or love or drink, or has met with any other\ndisaster. But when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him,\nhe will not make a study of that; he will disdain such a person, and\nwill assume his likeness, if at all, for a moment only when he is\nperforming some good action; at other times he will be ashamed to\nplay a part which he has never practised, nor will he like to fashion\nand frame himself after the baser models; he feels the employment\nof such an art, unless in jest, to be beneath him, and his mind revolts\nat it. \n\nSo I should expect, he replied. \nThen he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated\nout of Homer, that is to say, his style will be both imitative and\nnarrative; but there will be very little of the former, and a great\ndeal of the latter. Do you agree? \n\nCertainly, he said; that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily\ntake. \n\nBut there is another sort of character who will narrate anything,\nand, the worse lie is, the more unscrupulous he will be; nothing will\nbe too bad for him: and he will be ready to imitate anything, not\nas a joke, but in right good earnest, and before a large company.\nAs I was just now saying, he will attempt to represent the roll of\nthunder, the noise of wind and hall, or the creaking of wheels, and\npulleys, and the various sounds of flutes; pipes, trumpets, and all\nsorts of instruments: he will bark like a dog, bleat like a sheep,\nor crow like a cock; his entire art will consist in imitation of voice\nand gesture, and there will be very little narration. \n\nThat, he said, will be his mode of speaking. \nThese, then, are the two kinds of style? \nYes. \nAnd you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and\nhas but slight changes; and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen\nfor their simplicity, the result is that the speaker, if hc speaks\ncorrectly, is always pretty much the same in style, and he will keep\nwithin the limits of a single harmony (for the changes are not great),\nand in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm?\n\nThat is quite true, he said. \nWhereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of\nrhythms, if the music and the style are to correspond, because the\nstyle has all sorts of changes. \n\nThat is also perfectly true, he replied. \nAnd do not the two styles, or the mixture of the two, comprehend all\npoetry, and every form of expression in words? No one can say anything\nexcept in one or other of them or in both together. \n\nThey include all, he said. \nAnd shall we receive into our State all the three styles, or one only\nof the two unmixed styles? or would you include the mixed?\n\nI should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue.\n\nYes, I said, Adeimantus, but the mixed style is also very charming:\nand indeed the pantomimic, which is the opposite of the one chosen\nby you, is the most popular style with children and their attendants,\nand with the world in general. \n\nI do not deny it. \nBut I suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our\nState, in which human nature is not twofold or manifold, for one man\nplays one part only? \n\nYes; quite unsuitable. \nAnd this is the reason why in our State, and in our State only, we\nshall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also, and\na husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also, and a soldier\na soldier and not a trader also, and the same throughout?\n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen, who are\nso clever that they can imitate anything, comes to us, and makes a\nproposal to exhibit himself and his poetry, we will fall down and\nworship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being; but we must also\ninform him that in our State such as he are not permitted to exist;\nthe law will not allow them. And so when we have anointed him with\nmyrrh, and set a garland of wool upon his head, we shall send him\naway to another city. For we mean to employ for our souls' health\nthe rougher and severer poet or story-teller, who will imitate the\nstyle of the virtuous only, and will follow those models which we\nprescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers.\n\nWe certainly will, he said, if we have the power. \nThen now, my friend, I said, that part of music or literary education\nwhich relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished;\nfor the matter and manner have both been discussed. \n\nI think so too, he said. \nNext in order will follow melody and song. \nThat is obvious. \nEvery one can see already what we ought to say about them, if we are\nto be consistent with ourselves. \n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nI fear, said Glaucon, laughing, that the words 'every one' hardly\nincludes me, for I cannot at the moment say what they should be; though\nI may guess. \n\nAt any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts --the\nwords, the melody, and the rhythm; that degree of knowledge I may\npresuppose? \n\nYes, he said; so much as that you may. \nAnd as for the words, there surely be no difference words between\nwords which are and which are not set to music; both will conform\nto the same laws, and these have been already determined by us?\n\nYes. \nAnd the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words? \nCertainly. \nWe were saying, when we spoke of the subject-matter, that we had no\nneed of lamentations and strains of sorrow? \n\nTrue. \nAnd which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow? You are musical,\nand can tell me. \n\nThe harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor Lydian, and the\nfull-toned or bass Lydian, and such like. \n\nThese then, I said, must be banished; even to women who have a character\nto maintain they are of no use, and much less to men. Certainly.\n\nIn the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly\nunbecoming the character of our guardians. \n\nUtterly unbecoming. \nAnd which are the soft or drinking harmonies? \nThe Ionian, he replied, and the Lydian; they are termed 'relaxed.'\n\nWell, and are these of any military use? \nQuite the reverse, he replied; and if so the Dorian and the Phrygian\nare the only ones which you have left. \n\nI answered: Of the harmonies I know nothing, but I want to have one\nwarlike, to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the\nhour of danger and stern resolve, or when his cause is failing, and\nhe is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil,\nand at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step\nand a determination to endure; and another to be used by him in times\nof peace and freedom of action, when there is no pressure of necessity,\nand he is seeking to persuade God by prayer, or man by instruction\nand admonition, or on the other hand, when he is expressing his willingness\nto yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition, and which represents\nhim when by prudent conduct he has attained his end, not carried away\nby his success, but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances,\nand acquiescing in the event. These two harmonies I ask you to leave;\nthe strain of necessity and the strain of freedom, the strain of the\nunfortunate and the strain of the fortunate, the strain of courage,\nand the strain of temperance; these, I say, leave. \n\nAnd these, he replied, are the Dorian and Phrygian harmonies of which\nI was just now speaking. \n\nThen, I said, if these and these only are to be used in our songs\nand melodies, we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic\nscale? \n\nI suppose not. \nThen we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners\nand complex scales, or the makers of any other many-stringed curiously-harmonised\ninstruments? \n\nCertainly not. \nBut what do you say to flute-makers and flute-players? Would you admit\nthem into our State when you reflect that in this composite use of\nharmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together;\neven the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute?\n\nClearly not. \nThere remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city,\nand the shepherds may have a pipe in the country. \n\nThat is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument.\n\nThe preferring of Apollo and his instruments to Marsyas and his instruments\nis not at all strange, I said. \n\nNot at all, he replied. \nAnd so, by the dog of Egypt, we have been unconsciously purging the\nState, which not long ago we termed luxurious. \n\nAnd we have done wisely, he replied. \nThen let us now finish the purgation, I said. Next in order to harmonies,\nrhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to the same\nrules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre, or metres\nof every kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions\nof a courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found them,\nwe shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit,\nnot the words to the foot and melody. To say what these rhythms are\nwill be your duty --you must teach me them, as you have already taught\nme the harmonies. \n\nBut, indeed, he replied, I cannot tell you. I only know that there\nare some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems\nare framed, just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all\nthe harmonies are composed; that is an observation which I have made.\nBut of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations I am unable\nto say. \n\nThen, I said, we must take Damon into our counsels; and he will tell\nus what rhythms are expressive of meanness, or insolence, or fury,\nor other unworthiness, and what are to be reserved for the expression\nof opposite feelings. And I think that I have an indistinct recollection\nof his mentioning a complex Cretic rhythm; also a dactylic or heroic,\nand he arranged them in some manner which I do not quite understand,\nmaking the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot, long and\nshort alternating; and, unless I am mistaken, he spoke of an iambic\nas well as of a trochaic rhythm, and assigned to them short and long\nquantities. Also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the\nmovement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm; or perhaps a combination\nof the two; for I am not certain what he meant. These matters, however,\nas I was saying, had better be referred to Damon himself, for the\nanalysis of the subject would be difficult, you know. \n\nRather so, I should say. \nBut there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of\ngrace is an effect of good or bad rhythm. \n\nNone at all. \nAnd also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and\nbad style; and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style;\nfor our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the\nwords, and not the words by them. \n\nJust so, he said, they should follow the words. \nAnd will not the words and the character of the style depend on the\ntemper of the soul? \n\nYes. \nAnd everything else on the style? \nYes. \nThen beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend\non simplicity, --I mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly\nordered mind and character, not that other simplicity which is only\nan euphemism for folly? \n\nVery true, he replied. \nAnd if our youth are to do their work in life, must they not make\nthese graces and harmonies their perpetual aim? \n\nThey must. \nAnd surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive\nart are full of them, --weaving, embroidery, architecture, and every\nkind of manufacture; also nature, animal and vegetable, --in all of\nthem there is grace or the absence of grace. And ugliness and discord\nand inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature,\nas grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and\nbear their likeness. \n\nThat is quite true, he said. \nBut shall our superintendence go no further, and are the poets only\nto be required by us to express the image of the good in their works,\non pain, if they do anything else, of expulsion from our State? Or\nis the same control to be extended to other artists, and are they\nalso to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and\nintemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building\nand the other creative arts; and is he who cannot conform to this\nrule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our State,\nlest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him? We would not have\nour guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity, as in some noxious\npasture, and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower\nday by day, little by little, until they silently gather a festering\nmass of corruption in their own soul. Let our artists rather be those\nwho are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful;\nthen will our youth dwell in a land of health, amid fair sights and\nsounds, and receive the good in everything; and beauty, the effluence\nof fair works, shall flow into the eye and ear, like a health-giving\nbreeze from a purer region, and insensibly draw the soul from earliest\nyears into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason.\n\nThere can be no nobler training than that, he replied. \nAnd therefore, I said, Glaucon, musical training is a more potent\ninstrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way\ninto the inward places of the soul, on which they mightily fasten,\nimparting grace, and making the soul of him who is rightly educated\ngraceful, or of him who is ill-educated ungraceful; and also because\nhe who has received this true education of the inner being will most\nshrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature, and with\na true taste, while he praises and rejoices over and receives into\nhis soul the good, and becomes noble and good, he will justly blame\nand hate the bad, now in the days of his youth, even before he is\nable to know the reason why; and when reason comes he will recognise\nand salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar.\n\nYes, he said, I quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should\nbe trained in music and on the grounds which you mention.\n\nJust as in learning to read, I said, we were satisfied when we knew\nthe letters of the alphabet, which are very few, in all their recurring\nsizes and combinations; not slighting them as unimportant whether\nthey occupy a space large or small, but everywhere eager to make them\nout; and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until\nwe recognise them wherever they are found: \n\nTrue -- \nOr, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in\na mirror, only when we know the letters themselves; the same art and\nstudy giving us the knowledge of both: \n\nExactly -- \nEven so, as I maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom we have\nto educate, can ever become musical until we and they know the essential\nforms, in all their combinations, and can recognise them and their\nimages wherever they are found, not slighting them either in small\nthings or great, but believing them all to be within the sphere of\none art and study. \n\nMost assuredly. \nAnd when a beautiful soul harmonises with a beautiful form, and the\ntwo are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him\nwho has an eye to see it? \n\nThe fairest indeed. \nAnd the fairest is also the loveliest? \nThat may be assumed. \nAnd the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with\nthe loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious\nsoul? \n\nThat is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if\nthere be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of\nit, and will love all the same. \n\nI perceive, I said, that you have or have had experiences of this\nsort, and I agree. But let me ask you another question: Has excess\nof pleasure any affinity to temperance? \n\nHow can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a man of the use of\nhis faculties quite as much as pain. \n\nOr any affinity to virtue in general? \nNone whatever. \nAny affinity to wantonness and intemperance? \nYes, the greatest. \nAnd is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love?\n\nNo, nor a madder. \nWhereas true love is a love of beauty and order --temperate and harmonious?\n\nQuite true, he said. \nThen no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true\nlove? \n\nCertainly not. \nThen mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near\nthe lover and his beloved; neither of them can have any part in it\nif their love is of the right sort? \n\nNo, indeed, Socrates, it must never come near them. \nThen I suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make\na law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity\nto his love than a father would use to his son, and then only for\na noble purpose, and he must first have the other's consent; and this\nrule is to limit him in all his intercourse, and he is never to be\nseen going further, or, if he exceeds, he is to be deemed guilty of\ncoarseness and bad taste. \n\nI quite agree, he said. \nThus much of music, which makes a fair ending; for what should be\nthe end of music if not the love of beauty? \n\nI agree, he said. \nAfter music comes gymnastic, in which our youth are next to be trained.\n\nCertainly. \nGymnastic as well as music should begin in early years; the training\nin it should be careful and should continue through life. Now my belief\nis, --and this is a matter upon which I should like to have your opinion\nin confirmation of my own, but my own belief is, --not that the good\nbody by any bodily excellence improves the soul, but, on the contrary,\nthat the good soul, by her own excellence, improves the body as far\nas this may be possible. What do you say? \n\nYes, I agree. \nThen, to the mind when adequately trained, we shall be right in handing\nover the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid prolixity\nwe will now only give the general outlines of the subject.\n\nVery good. \nThat they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked\nby us; for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk\nand not know where in the world he is. \n\nYes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take\ncare of him is ridiculous indeed. \n\nBut next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training\nfor the great contest of all --are they not? \n\nYes, he said. \nAnd will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?\n\nWhy not? \nI am afraid, I said, that a habit of body such as they have is but\na sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilous to health. Do you not\nobserve that these athletes sleep away their lives, and are liable\nto most dangerous illnesses if they depart, in ever so slight a degree,\nfrom their customary regimen? \n\nYes, I do. \nThen, I said, a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior\nathletes, who are to be like wakeful dogs, and to see and hear with\nthe utmost keenness; amid the many changes of water and also of food,\nof summer heat and winter cold, which they will have to endure when\non a campaign, they must not be liable to break down in health.\n\nThat is my view. \nThe really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music\nwhich we were just now describing. \n\nHow so? \nWhy, I conceive that there is a gymnastic which, like our music, is\nsimple and good; and especially the military gymnastic. \n\nWhat do you mean? \nMy meaning may be learned from Homer; he, you know, feeds his heroes\nat their feasts, when they are campaigning, on soldiers' fare; they\nhave no fish, although they are on the shores of the Hellespont, and\nthey are not allowed boiled meats but only roast, which is the food\nmost convenient for soldiers, requiring only that they should light\na fire, and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans.\n\nTrue. \nAnd I can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere\nmentioned in Homer. In proscribing them, however, he is not singular;\nall professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in\ngood condition should take nothing of the kind. \n\nYes, he said; and knowing this, they are quite right in not taking\nthem. \n\nThen you would not approve of Syracusan dinners, and the refinements\nof Sicilian cookery? \n\nI think not. \nNor, if a man is to be in condition, would you allow him to have a\nCorinthian girl as his fair friend? \n\nCertainly not. \nNeither would you approve of the delicacies, as they are thought,\nof Athenian confectionery? \n\nCertainly not. \nAll such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody\nand song composed in the panharmonic style, and in all the rhythms.\nExactly. \n\nThere complexity engendered license, and here disease; whereas simplicity\nin music was the parent of temperance in the soul; and simplicity\nin gymnastic of health in the body. \n\nMost true, he said. \nBut when intemperance and disease multiply in a State, halls of justice\nand medicine are always being opened; and the arts of the doctor and\nthe lawyer give themselves airs, finding how keen is the interest\nwhich not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them.\n\nOf course. \nAnd yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state\nof education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort\nof people need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but\nalso those who would profess to have had a liberal education? Is it\nnot disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a\nman should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has\nnone of his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into\nthe hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him?\n\nOf all things, he said, the most disgraceful. \nWould you say 'most,' I replied, when you consider that there is a\nfurther stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life-long litigant,\npassing all his days in the courts, either as plaintiff or defendant,\nbut is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness;\nhe imagines that he is a master in dishonesty; able to take every\ncrooked turn, and wriggle into and out of every hole, bending like\na withy and getting out of the way of justice: and all for what? --in\norder to gain small points not worth mentioning, he not knowing that\nso to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is\na far higher and nobler sort of thing. Is not that still more disgraceful?\n\nYes, he said, that is still more disgraceful. \nWell, I said, and to require the help of medicine, not when a wound\nhas to be cured, or on occasion of an epidemic, but just because,\nby indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing,\nmen fill themselves with waters and winds, as if their bodies were\na marsh, compelling the ingenious sons of Asclepius to find more names\nfor diseases, such as flatulence and catarrh; is not this, too, a\ndisgrace? \n\nYes, he said, they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names\nto diseases. \n\nYes, I said, and I do not believe that there were any such diseases\nin the days of Asclepius; and this I infer from the circumstance that\nthe hero Eurypylus, after he has been wounded in Homer, drinks a posset\nof Pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley-meal and grated cheese,\nwhich are certainly inflammatory, and yet the sons of Asclepius who\nwere at the Trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink,\nor rebuke Patroclus, who is treating his case. \n\nWell, he said, that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given\nto a person in his condition. \n\nNot so extraordinary, I replied, if you bear in mind that in former\ndays, as is commonly said, before the time of Herodicus, the guild\nof Asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine, which\nmay be said to educate diseases. But Herodicus, being a trainer, and\nhimself of a sickly constitution, by a combination of training and\ndoctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself,\nand secondly the rest of the world. \n\nHow was that? he said. \nBy the invention of lingering death; for he had a mortal disease which\nhe perpetually tended, and as recovery was out of the question, he\npassed his entire life as a valetudinarian; he could do nothing but\nattend upon himself, and he was in constant torment whenever he departed\nin anything from his usual regimen, and so dying hard, by the help\nof science he struggled on to old age. \n\nA rare reward of his skill! \nYes, I said; a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood\nthat, if Asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian\narts, the omission arose, not from ignorance or inexperience of such\na branch of medicine, but because he knew that in all well-ordered\nstates every individual has an occupation to which he must attend,\nand has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill. This\nwe remark in the case of the artisan, but, ludicrously enough, do\nnot apply the same rule to people of the richer sort. \n\nHow do you mean? he said. \nI mean this: When a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough\nand ready cure; an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife, --these\nare his remedies. And if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics,\nand tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head, and all that\nsort of thing, he replies at once that he has no time to be ill, and\nthat he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease\nto the neglect of his customary employment; and therefore bidding\ngood-bye to this sort of physician, he resumes his ordinary habits,\nand either gets well and lives and does his business, or, if his constitution\nfalls, he dies and has no more trouble. \n\nYes, he said, and a man in his condition of life ought to use the\nart of medicine thus far only. \n\nHas he not, I said, an occupation; and what profit would there be\nin his life if he were deprived of his occupation? \n\nQuite true, he said. \nBut with the rich man this is otherwise; of him we do not say that\nhe has any specially appointed work which he must perform, if he would\nlive. \n\nHe is generally supposed to have nothing to do. \nThen you never heard of the saying of Phocylides, that as soon as\na man has a livelihood he should practise virtue? \n\nNay, he said, I think that he had better begin somewhat sooner.\n\nLet us not have a dispute with him about this, I said; but rather\nask ourselves: Is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man,\nor can he live without it? And if obligatory on him, then let us raise\na further question, whether this dieting of disorders which is an\nimpediment to the application of the mind t in carpentering and the\nmechanical arts, does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment\nof Phocylides? \n\nOf that, he replied, there can be no doubt; such excessive care of\nthe body, when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic, is most inimical\nto the practice of virtue. \n\nYes, indeed, I replied, and equally incompatible with the management\nof a house, an army, or an office of state; and, what is most important\nof all, irreconcilable with any kind of study or thought or self-reflection\n--there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to\nbe ascribed to philosophy, and hence all practising or making trial\nof virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped; for a man is\nalways fancying that he is being made ill, and is in constant anxiety\nabout the state of his body. \n\nYes, likely enough. \nAnd therefore our politic Asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited\nthe power of his art only to persons who, being generally of healthy\nconstitution and habits of life, had a definite ailment; such as these\nhe cured by purges and operations, and bade them live as usual, herein\nconsulting the interests of the State; but bodies which disease had\npenetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure\nby gradual processes of evacuation and infusion: he did not want to\nlengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or to have weak fathers begetting\nweaker sons; --if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he\nhad no business to cure him; for such a cure would have been of no\nuse either to himself, or to the State. \n\nThen, he said, you regard Asclepius as a statesman. \nClearly; and his character is further illustrated by his sons. Note\nthat they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines\nof which I am speaking at the siege of Troy: You will remember how,\nwhen Pandarus wounded Menelaus, they \n\nSucked the blood out of the wound, and sprinkled soothing remedies,\nbut they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or\ndrink in the case of Menelaus, any more than in the case of Eurypylus;\nthe remedies, as they conceived, were enough to heal any man who before\nhe was wounded was healthy and regular in habits; and even though\nhe did happen to drink a posset of Pramnian wine, he might get well\nall the same. But they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and\nintemperate subjects, whose lives were of no use either to themselves\nor others; the art of medicine was not designed for their good, and\nthough they were as rich as Midas, the sons of Asclepius would have\ndeclined to attend them. \n\nThey were very acute persons, those sons of Asclepius. \nNaturally so, I replied. Nevertheless, the tragedians and Pindar disobeying\nour behests, although they acknowledge that Asclepius was the son\nof Apollo, say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who\nwas at the point of death, and for this reason he was struck by lightning.\nBut we, in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us, will\nnot believe them when they tell us both; --if he was the son of a\ngod, we maintain that hd was not avaricious; or, if he was avaricious\nhe was not the son of a god. \n\nAll that, Socrates, is excellent; but I should like to put a question\nto you: Ought there not to be good physicians in a State, and are\nnot the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions\ngood and bad? and are not the best judges in like manner those who\nare acquainted with all sorts of moral natures? \n\nYes, I said, I too would have good judges and good physicians. But\ndo you know whom I think good? \n\nWill you tell me? \nI will, if I can. Let me however note that in the same question you\njoin two things which are not the same. \n\nHow so? he asked. \nWhy, I said, you join physicians and judges. Now the most skilful\nphysicians are those who, from their youth upwards, have combined\nwith the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease;\nthey had better not be robust in health, and should have had all manner\nof diseases in their own persons. For the body, as I conceive, is\nnot the instrument with which they cure the body; in that case we\ncould not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly; but they cure\nthe body with the mind, and the mind which has become and is sick\ncan cure nothing. \n\nThat is very true, he said. \nBut with the judge it is otherwise; since he governs mind by mind;\nhe ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds, and\nto have associated with them from youth upwards, and to have gone\nthrough the whole calendar of crime, only in order that he may quickly\ninfer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from\nhis own self-consciousness; the honourable mind which is to form a\nhealthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of\nevil habits when young. And this is the reason why in youth good men\noften appear to be simple, and are easily practised upon by the dishonest,\nbecause they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls.\n\nYes, he said, they are far too apt to be deceived. \nTherefore, I said, the judge should not be young; he should have learned\nto know evil, not from his own soul, but from late and long observation\nof the nature of evil in others: knowledge should be his guide, not\npersonal experience. \n\nYes, he said, that is the ideal of a judge. \nYes, I replied, and he will be a good man (which is my answer to your\nquestion); for he is good who has a good soul. But the cunning and\nsuspicious nature of which we spoke, --he who has committed many crimes,\nand fancies himself to be a master in wickedness, when he is amongst\nhis fellows, is wonderful in the precautions which he takes, because\nhe judges of them by himself: but when he gets into the company of\nmen of virtue, who have the experience of age, he appears to be a\nfool again, owing to his unseasonable suspicions; he cannot recognise\nan honest man, because he has no pattern of honesty in himself; at\nthe same time, as the bad are more numerous than the good, and he\nmeets with them oftener, he thinks himself, and is by others thought\nto be, rather wise than foolish. \n\nMost true, he said. \nThen the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man,\nbut the other; for vice cannot know virtue too, but a virtuous nature,\neducated by time, will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice:\nthe virtuous, and not the vicious, man has wisdom --in my opinion.\n\nAnd in mine also. \nThis is the sort of medicine, and this is the sort of law, which you\nsanction in your State. They will minister to better natures, giving\nhealth both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their\nbodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls\nthey will put an end to themselves. \n\nThat is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the State.\n\nAnd thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music\nwhich, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to\nlaw. \n\nClearly. \nAnd the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to practise\nthe simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine unless\nin some extreme case. \n\nThat I quite believe. \nThe very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate\nthe spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his strength;\nhe will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen to develop\nhis muscles. \n\nVery right, he said. \nNeither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as\nis often supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other\nfir the training of the body. \n\nWhat then is the real object of them? \nI believe, I said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly\nthe improvement of the soul. \n\nHow can that be? he asked. \nDid you never observe, I said, the effect on the mind itself of exclusive\ndevotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion\nto music? \n\nIn what way shown? he said. \nThe one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of\nsoftness and effeminacy, I replied. \n\nYes, he said, I am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much\nof a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond\nwhat is good for him. \n\nYet surely, I said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if\nrightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified,\nis liable to become hard and brutal. \n\nThat I quite think. \nOn the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.\nAnd this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but,\nif educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate. \n\nTrue. \nAnd in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?\n\nAssuredly. \nAnd both should be in harmony? \nBeyond question. \nAnd the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?\n\nYes. \nAnd the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish? \nVery true. \nAnd, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his\nsoul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy\nairs of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed\nin warbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process\nthe passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made\nuseful, instead of brittle and useless. But, if he carries on the\nsoftening and soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt\nand waste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews\nof his soul; and he becomes a feeble warrior. \n\nVery true. \nIf the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily\naccomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of music\nweakening the spirit renders him excitable; --on the least provocation\nhe flames up at once, and is speedily extinguished; instead of having\nspirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable.\n\nExactly. \nAnd so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great\nfeeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy,\nat first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit,\nand lie becomes twice the man that he was. \n\nCertainly. \nAnd what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no con-a verse\nwith the Muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be\nin him, having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought\nor culture, grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking\nup or receiving nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their\nmists? \n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never\nusing the weapon of persuasion, --he is like a wild beast, all violence\nand fierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in\nall ignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and\ngrace. \n\nThat is quite true, he said. \nAnd as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited\nand the other the philosophical, some God, as I should say, has given\nmankind two arts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul\nand body), in order that these two principles (like the strings of\nan instrument) may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly\nharmonised. \n\nThat appears to be the intention. \nAnd he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions,\nand best attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true\nmusician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the\nstrings. \n\nYou are quite right, Socrates. \nAnd such a presiding genius will be always required in our State if\nthe government is to last. \n\nYes, he will be absolutely necessary. \nSuch, then, are our principles of nurture and education: Where would\nbe the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens,\nor about their hunting and coursing, their gymnastic and equestrian\ncontests? For these all follow the general principle, and having found\nthat, we shall have no difficulty in discovering them. \n\nI dare say that there will be no difficulty. \nVery good, I said; then what is the next question? Must we not ask\nwho are to be rulers and who subjects? \n\nCertainly. \nThere can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger.\n\nClearly. \nAnd that the best of these must rule. \nThat is also clear. \nNow, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry?\n\nYes. \nAnd as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they\nnot be those who have most the character of guardians? \n\nYes. \nAnd to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a\nspecial care of the State? \n\nTrue. \nAnd a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?\n\nTo be sure. \nAnd he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having\nthe same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil\nfortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?\n\nVery true, he replied. \nThen there must be a selection. Let us note among the guardians those\nwho in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is\nfor the good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what\nis against her interests. \n\nThose are the right men. \nAnd they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may\nsee whether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence\neither of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of\nduty to the State. \n\nHow cast off? he said. \nI will explain to you, I replied. A resolution may go out of a man's\nmind either with his will or against his will; with his will when\nhe gets rid of a falsehood and learns better, against his will whenever\nhe is deprived of a truth. \n\nI understand, he said, the willing loss of a resolution; the meaning\nof the unwilling I have yet to learn. \n\nWhy, I said, do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good,\nand willingly of evil? Is not to have lost the truth an evil, and\nto possess the truth a good? and you would agree that to conceive\nthings as they are is to possess the truth? \n\nYes, he replied; I agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived\nof truth against their will. \n\nAnd is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft, or\nforce, or enchantment? \n\nStill, he replied, I do not understand you. \nI fear that I must have been talking darkly, like the tragedians.\nI only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others\nforget; argument steals away the hearts of one class, and time of\nthe other; and this I call theft. Now you understand me?\n\nYes. \nThose again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain\nor grief compels to change their opinion. \n\nI understand, he said, and you are quite right. \nAnd you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change\ntheir minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the\nsterner influence of fear? \n\nYes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.\n\nTherefore, as I was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best\nguardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest\nof the State is to be the rule of their lives. We must watch them\nfrom their youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they\nare most likely to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers\nand is not deceived is to be selected, and he who falls in the trial\nis to be rejected. That will be the way? \n\nYes. \nAnd there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed\nfor them, in which they will be made to give further proof of the\nsame qualities. \n\nVery right, he replied. \nAnd then, I said, we must try them with enchantments that is the third\nsort of test --and see what will be their behaviour: like those who\ntake colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature,\nso must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass\nthem into pleasures, and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved\nin the furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against\nall enchantments, and of a noble bearing always, good guardians of\nthemselves and of the music which they have learned, and retaining\nunder all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as\nwill be most serviceable to the individual and to the State. And he\nwho at every age, as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out\nof the trial victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian\nof the State; he shall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive\nsepulture and other memorials of honour, the greatest that we have\nto give. But him who fails, we must reject. I am inclined to think\nthat this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should\nbe chosen and appointed. I speak generally, and not with any pretension\nto exactness. \n\nAnd, speaking generally, I agree with you, he said. \nAnd perhaps the word 'guardian' in the fullest sense ought to be applied\nto this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies\nand maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may not\nhave the will, or the others the power, to harm us. The young men\nwhom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries\nand supporters of the principles of the rulers. \n\nI agree with you, he said. \nHow then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we\nlately spoke --just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers, if\nthat be possible, and at any rate the rest of the city? \n\nWhat sort of lie? he said. \nNothing new, I replied; only an old Phoenician tale of what has often\noccurred before now in other places, (as the poets say, and have made\nthe world believe,) though not in our time, and I do not know whether\nsuch an event could ever happen again, or could now even be made probable,\nif it did. \n\nHow your words seem to hesitate on your lips! \nYou will not wonder, I replied, at my hesitation when you have heard.\n\nSpeak, he said, and fear not. \nWell then, I will speak, although I really know not how to look you\nin the face, or in what words to utter the audacious fiction, which\nI propose to communicate gradually, first to the rulers, then to the\nsoldiers, and lastly to the people. They are to be told that their\nyouth was a dream, and the education and training which they received\nfrom us, an appearance only; in reality during all that time they\nwere being formed and fed in the womb of the earth, where they themselves\nand their arms and appurtenances were manufactured; when they were\ncompleted, the earth, their mother, sent them up; and so, their country\nbeing their mother and also their nurse, they are bound to advise\nfor her good, and to defend her against attacks, and her citizens\nthey are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers.\n\nYou had good reason, he said, to be ashamed of the lie which you were\ngoing to tell. \n\nTrue, I replied, but there is more coming; I have only told you half.\nCitizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are brothers, yet\nGod has framed you differently. Some of you have the power of command,\nand in the composition of these he has mingled gold, wherefore also\nthey have the greatest honour; others he has made of silver, to be\nauxillaries; others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he\nhas composed of brass and iron; and the species will generally be\npreserved in the children. But as all are of the same original stock,\na golden parent will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent\na golden son. And God proclaims as a first principle to the rulers,\nand above all else, that there is nothing which should so anxiously\nguard, or of which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity\nof the race. They should observe what elements mingle in their off\nspring; for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture\nof brass and iron, then nature orders a transposition of ranks, and\nthe eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because\nhe has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan,\njust as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold\nor silver in them are raised to honour, and become guardians or auxiliaries.\nFor an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the State,\nit will be destroyed. Such is the tale; is there any possibility of\nmaking our citizens believe in it? \n\nNot in the present generation, he replied; there is no way of accomplishing\nthis; but their sons may be made to believe in the tale, and their\nsons' sons, and posterity after them. \n\nI see the difficulty, I replied; yet the fostering of such a belief\nwill make them care more for the city and for one another. Enough,\nhowever, of the fiction, which may now fly abroad upon the wings of\nrumour, while we arm our earth-born heroes, and lead them forth under\nthe command of their rulers. Let them look round and select a spot\nwhence they can best suppress insurrection, if any prove refractory\nwithin, and also defend themselves against enemies, who like wolves\nmay come down on the fold from without; there let them encamp, and\nwhen they have encamped, let them sacrifice to the proper Gods and\nprepare their dwellings. \n\nJust so, he said. \nAnd their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold\nof winter and the heat of summer. \n\nI suppose that you mean houses, he replied. \nYes, I said; but they must be the houses of soldiers, and not of shop-keepers.\n\nWhat is the difference? he said. \nThat I will endeavour to explain, I replied. To keep watchdogs, who,\nfrom want of discipline or hunger, or some evil habit, or evil habit\nor other, would turn upon the sheep and worry them, and behave not\nlike dogs but wolves, would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd?\n\nTruly monstrous, he said. \nAnd therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries, being\nstronger than our citizens, may not grow to be too much for them and\nbecome savage tyrants instead of friends and allies? \n\nYes, great care should be taken. \nAnd would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard?\n\nBut they are well-educated already, he replied. \nI cannot be so confident, my dear Glaucon, I said; I am much certain\nthat they ought to be, and that true education, whatever that may\nbe, will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them\nin their relations to one another, and to those who are under their\nprotection. \n\nVery true, he replied. \nAnd not only their education, but their habitations, and all that\nbelongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue\nas guardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. Any\nman of sense must acknowledge that. \n\nHe must. \nThen let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to\nrealize our idea of them. In the first place, none of them should\nhave any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary;\nneither should they have a private house or store closed against any\none who has a mind to enter; their provisions should be only such\nas are required by trained warriors, who are men of temperance and\ncourage; they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate\nof pay, enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more; and they\nwill go and live together like soldiers in a camp. Gold and silver\nwe will tell them that they have from God; the diviner metal is within\nthem, and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current\namong men, and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly\nadmixture; for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy\ndeeds, but their own is undefiled. And they alone of all the citizens\nmay not touch or handle silver or gold, or be under the same roof\nwith them, or wear them, or drink from them. And this will be their\nsalvation, and they will be the saviours of the State. But should\nthey ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own, they will\nbecome housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians, enemies and\ntyrants instead of allies of the other citizens; hating and being\nhated, plotting and being plotted against, they will pass their whole\nlife in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies,\nand the hour of ruin, both to themselves and to the rest of the State,\nwill be at hand. For all which reasons may we not say that thus shall\nour State be ordered, and that these shall be the regulations appointed\nby us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters?\nother \n\nYes, said Glaucon. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK IV\n\nAdeimantus - SOCRATES \n\nHere Adeimantus interposed a question: How would you answer, Socrates,\nsaid he, if a person were to say that you are making these people\nmiserable, and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness; the\ncity in fact belongs to them, but they are none the better for it;\nwhereas other men acquire lands, and build large and handsome houses,\nand have everything handsome about them, offering sacrifices to the\ngods on their own account, and practising hospitality; moreover, as\nyou were saying just now, they have gold and silver, and all that\nis usual among the favourites of fortune; but our poor citizens are\nno better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always\nmounting guard? \n\nYes, I said; and you may add that they are only fed, and not paid\nin addition to their food, like other men; and therefore they cannot,\nif they would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend\non a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes,\nis thought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same\nnature might be added. \n\nBut, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.\n\nYou mean to ask, I said, what will be our answer? \nYes. \nIf we proceed along the old path, my belief, I said, is that we shall\nfind the answer. And our answer will be that, even as they are, our\nguardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim\nin founding the State was not the disproportionate happiness of any\none class, but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that\nin a State which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we\nshould be most likely to find Justice, and in the ill-ordered State\ninjustice: and, having found them, we might then decide which of the\ntwo is the happier. At present, I take it, we are fashioning the happy\nState, not piecemeal, or with a view of making a few happy citizens,\nbut as a whole; and by-and-by we will proceed to view the opposite\nkind of State. Suppose that we were painting a statue, and some one\ncame up to us and said, Why do you not put the most beautiful colours\non the most beautiful parts of the body --the eyes ought to be purple,\nbut you have made them black --to him we might fairly answer, Sir,\nyou would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that\nthey are no longer eyes; consider rather whether, by giving this and\nthe other features their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful.\nAnd so I say to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a\nsort of happiness which will make them anything but guardians; for\nwe too can clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns\nof gold on their heads, and bid them till the ground as much as they\nlike, and no more. Our potters also might be allowed to repose on\ncouches, and feast by the fireside, passing round the winecup, while\ntheir wheel is conveniently at hand, and working at pottery only as\nmuch as they like; in this way we might make every class happy-and\nthen, as you imagine, the whole State would be happy. But do not put\nthis idea into our heads; for, if we listen to you, the husbandman\nwill be no longer a husbandman, the potter will cease to be a potter,\nand no one will have the character of any distinct class in the State.\nNow this is not of much consequence where the corruption of society,\nand pretension to be what you are not, is confined to cobblers; but\nwhen the guardians of the laws and of the government are only seemingly\nand not real guardians, then see how they turn the State upside down;\nand on the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and\nhappiness to the State. We mean our guardians to be true saviours\nand not the destroyers of the State, whereas our opponent is thinking\nof peasants at a festival, who are enjoying a life of revelry, not\nof citizens who are doing their duty to the State. But, if so, we\nmean different things, and he is speaking of something which is not\na State. And therefore we must consider whether in appointing our\nguardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually,\nor whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the\nState as a whole. But the latter be the truth, then the guardians\nand auxillaries, and all others equally with them, must be compelled\nor induced to do their own work in the best way. And thus the whole\nState will grow up in a noble order, and the several classes will\nreceive the proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them.\n\nI think that you are quite right. \nI wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to\nme. \n\nWhat may that be? \nThere seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.\n\nWhat are they? \nWealth, I said, and poverty. \nHow do they act? \nThe process is as follows: When a potter becomes rich, will he, think\nyou, any longer take the same pains with his art? \n\nCertainly not. \nHe will grow more and more indolent and careless? \nVery true. \nAnd the result will be that he becomes a worse potter? \nYes; he greatly deteriorates. \nBut, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself\ntools or instruments, he will not work equally well himself, nor will\nhe teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well. \n\nCertainly not. \nThen, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen\nand their work are equally liable to degenerate? \n\nThat is evident. \nHere, then, is a discovery of new evils, I said, against which the\nguardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city unobserved.\n\nWhat evils? \nWealth, I said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and indolence,\nand the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of discontent.\n\nThat is very true, he replied; but still I should like to know, Socrates,\nhow our city will be able to go to war, especially against an enemy\nwho is rich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of war.\n\nThere would certainly be a difficulty, I replied, in going to war\nwith one such enemy; but there is no difficulty where there are two\nof them. \n\nHow so? he asked. \nIn the first place, I said, if we have to fight, our side will be\ntrained warriors fighting against an army of rich men. \n\nThat is true, he said. \nAnd do you not suppose, Adeimantus, that a single boxer who was perfect\nin his art would easily be a match for two stout and well-to-do gentlemen\nwho were not boxers? \n\nHardly, if they came upon him at once. \nWhat, not, I said, if he were able to run away and then turn and strike\nat the one who first came up? And supposing he were to do this several\ntimes under the heat of a scorching sun, might he not, being an expert,\noverturn more than one stout personage? \n\nCertainly, he said, there would be nothing wonderful in that.\n\nAnd yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science\nand practice of boxing than they have in military qualities.\n\nLikely enough. \nThen we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two\nor three times their own number? \n\nI agree with you, for I think you right. \nAnd suppose that, before engaging, our citizens send an embassy to\none of the two cities, telling them what is the truth: Silver and\ngold we neither have nor are permitted to have, but you may; do you\ntherefore come and help us in war, of and take the spoils of the other\ncity: Who, on hearing these words, would choose to fight against lean\nwiry dogs, rather th than, with the dogs on their side, against fat\nand tender sheep? \n\nThat is not likely; and yet there might be a danger to the poor State\nif the wealth of many States were to be gathered into one.\n\nBut how simple of you to use the term State at all of any but our\nown! \n\nWhy so? \nYou ought to speak of other States in the plural number; not one of\nthem is a city, but many cities, as they say in the game. For indeed\nany city, however small, is in fact divided into two, one the city\nof the poor, the other of the rich; these are at war with one another;\nand in either there are many smaller divisions, and you would be altogether\nbeside the mark if you treated them all as a single State. But if\nyou deal with them as many, and give the wealth or power or persons\nof the one to the others, you will always have a great many friends\nand not many enemies. And your State, while the wise order which has\nnow been prescribed continues to prevail in her, will be the greatest\nof States, I do not mean to say in reputation or appearance, but in\ndeed and truth, though she number not more than a thousand defenders.\nA single State which is her equal you will hardly find, either among\nHellenes or barbarians, though many that appear to be as great and\nmany times greater. \n\nThat is most true, he said. \nAnd what, I said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when\nthey are considering the size of the State and the amount of territory\nwhich they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?\n\nWhat limit would you propose? \nI would allow the State to increase so far as is consistent with unity;\nthat, I think, is the proper limit. \n\nVery good, he said. \nHere then, I said, is another order which will have to be conveyed\nto our guardians: Let our city be accounted neither large nor small,\nbut one and self-sufficing. \n\nAnd surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose\nupon them. \n\nAnd the other, said I, of which we were speaking before is lighter\nstill, -I mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians\nwhen inferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring\nof the lower classes, when naturally superior. The intention was,\nthat, in the case of the citizens generally, each individual should\nbe put to the use for which nature which nature intended him, one\nto one work, and then every man would do his own business, and be\none and not many; and so the whole city would be one and not many.\n\nYes, he said; that is not so difficult. \nThe regulations which we are prescribing, my good Adeimantus, are\nnot, as might be supposed, a number of great principles, but trifles\nall, if care be taken, as the saying is, of the one great thing, --a\nthing, however, which I would rather call, not great, but sufficient\nfor our purpose. \n\nWhat may that be? he asked. \nEducation, I said, and nurture: If our citizens are well educated,\nand grow into sensible men, they will easily see their way through\nall these, as well as other matters which I omit; such, for example,\nas marriage, the possession of women and the procreation of children,\nwhich will all follow the general principle that friends have all\nthings in common, as the proverb says. \n\nThat will be the best way of settling them. \nAlso, I said, the State, if once started well, moves with accumulating\nforce like a wheel. For good nurture and education implant good constitutions,\nand these good constitutions taking root in a good education improve\nmore and more, and this improvement affects the breed in man as in\nother animals. \n\nVery possibly, he said. \nThen to sum up: This is the point to which, above all, the attention\nof our rulers should be directed, --that music and gymnastic be preserved\nin their original form, and no innovation made. They must do their\nutmost to maintain them intact. And when any one says that mankind\nmost regard \n\nThe newest song which the singers have, they will be afraid that he\nmay be praising, not new songs, but a new kind of song; and this ought\nnot to be praised, or conceived to be the meaning of the poet; for\nany musical innovation is full of danger to the whole State, and ought\nto be prohibited. So Damon tells me, and I can quite believe him;-he\nsays that when modes of music change, of the State always change with\nthem. \n\nYes, said Adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to Damon's and your\nown. \n\nThen, I said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress\nin music? \n\nYes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals\nin. \n\nYes, I replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears\nharmless. \n\nWhy, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by\nlittle this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates\ninto manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades\ncontracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws\nand constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last, Socrates,\nby an overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.\n\nIs that true? I said. \nThat is my belief, he replied. \nThen, as I was saying, our youth should be trained from the first\nin a stricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and the youths\nthemselves become lawless, they can never grow up into well-conducted\nand virtuous citizens. \n\nVery true, he said. \nAnd when they have made a good beginning in play, and by the help\nof music have gained the habit of good order, then this habit of order,\nin a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others! will accompany\nthem in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them, and\nif there be any fallen places a principle in the State will raise\nthem up again. \n\nVery true, he said. \nThus educated, they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which\ntheir predecessors have altogether neglected. \n\nWhat do you mean? \nI mean such things as these: --when the young are to be silent before\ntheir elders; how they are to show respect to them by standing and\nmaking them sit; what honour is due to parents; what garments or shoes\nare to be worn; the mode of dressing the hair; deportment and manners\nin general. You would agree with me? \n\nYes. \nBut there is, I think, small wisdom in legislating about such matters,\n--I doubt if it is ever done; nor are any precise written enactments\nabout them likely to be lasting. \n\nImpossible. \nIt would seem, Adeimantus, that the direction in which education starts\na man, will determine his future life. Does not like always attract\nlike? \n\nTo be sure. \nUntil some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good,\nand may be the reverse of good? \n\nThat is not to be denied. \nAnd for this reason, I said, I shall not attempt to legislate further\nabout them. \n\nNaturally enough, he replied. \nWell, and about the business of the agora, dealings and the ordinary\ndealings between man and man, or again about agreements with the commencement\nwith artisans; about insult and injury, of the commencement of actions,\nand the appointment of juries, what would you say? there may also\narise questions about any impositions and extractions of market and\nharbour dues which may be required, and in general about the regulations\nof markets, police, harbours, and the like. But, oh heavens! shall\nwe condescend to legislate on any of these particulars? \n\nI think, he said, that there is no need to impose laws about them\non good men; what regulations are necessary they will find out soon\nenough for themselves. \n\nYes, I said, my friend, if God will only preserve to them the laws\nwhich we have given them. \n\nAnd without divine help, said Adeimantus, they will go on for ever\nmaking and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining\nperfection. \n\nYou would compare them, I said, to those invalids who, having no self-restraint,\nwill not leave off their habits of intemperance? \n\nExactly. \nYes, I said; and what a delightful life they lead! they are always\ndoctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders, and always\nfancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises\nthem to try. \n\nSuch cases are very common, he said, with invalids of this sort.\n\nYes, I replied; and the charming thing is that they deem him their\nworst enemy who tells them the truth, which is simply that, unless\nthey give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling, neither\ndrug nor cautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail.\n\nCharming! he replied. I see nothing charming in going into a passion\nwith a man who tells you what is right. \n\nThese gentlemen, I said, do not seem to be in your good graces.\n\nAssuredly not. \nNor would you praise the behaviour of States which act like the men\nwhom I was just now describing. For are there not ill-ordered States\nin which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the\nconstitution; and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under\nthis regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in\nanticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and\ngood statesman --do not these States resemble the persons whom I was\ndescribing? \n\nYes, he said; the States are as bad as the men; and I am very far\nfrom praising them. \n\nBut do you not admire, I said, the coolness and dexterity of these\nready ministers of political corruption? \n\nYes, he said, I do; but not of all of them, for there are some whom\nthe applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they\nare really statesmen, and these are not much to be admired.\n\nWhat do you mean? I said; you should have more feeling for them. When\na man cannot measure, and a great many others who cannot measure declare\nthat he is four cubits high, can he help believing what they say?\n\nNay, he said, certainly not in that case. \nWell, then, do not be angry with them; for are they not as good as\na play, trying their hand at paltry reforms such as I was describing;\nthey are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end\nof frauds in contracts, and the other rascalities which I was mentioning,\nnot knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra?\n\nYes, he said; that is just what they are doing. \nI conceive, I said, that the true legislator will not trouble himself\nwith this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution\neither in an ill-ordered or in a well-ordered State; for in the former\nthey are quite useless, and in the latter there will be no difficulty\nin devising them; and many of them will naturally flow out of our\nprevious regulations. \n\nWhat, then, he said, is still remaining to us of the work of legislation?\n\nNothing to us, I replied; but to Apollo, the God of Delphi, there\nremains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things\nof all. \n\nWhich are they? he said. \nThe institution of temples and sacrifices, and the entire service\nof gods, demigods, and heroes; also the ordering of the repositories\nof the dead, and the rites which have to be observed by him who would\npropitiate the inhabitants of the world below. These are matters of\nwhich we are ignorant ourselves, and as founders of a city we should\nbe unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity.\nHe is the god who sits in the center, on the navel of the earth, and\nhe is the interpreter of religion to all mankind. \n\nYou are right, and we will do as you propose. \nBut where, amid all this, is justice? son of Ariston, tell me where.\nNow that our city has been made habitable, light a candle and search,\nand get your brother and Polemarchus and the rest of our friends to\nhelp, and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where\ninjustice, and in what they differ from one another, and which of\nthem the man who would be happy should have for his portion, whether\nseen or unseen by gods and men. \n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nNonsense, said Glaucon: did you not promise to search yourself, saying\nthat for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety?\n\nI do not deny that I said so, and as you remind me, I will be as good\nas my word; but you must join. \n\nWe will, he replied. \nWell, then, I hope to make the discovery in this way: I mean to begin\nwith the assumption that our State, if rightly ordered, is perfect.\n\nThat is most certain. \nAnd being perfect, is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and\njust. \n\nThat is likewise clear. \nAnd whichever of these qualities we find in the State, the one which\nis not found will be the residue? \n\nVery good. \nIf there were four things, and we were searching for one of them,\nwherever it might be, the one sought for might be known to us from\nthe first, and there would be no further trouble; or we might know\nthe other three first, and then the fourth would clearly be the one\nleft. \n\nVery true, he said. \nAnd is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues, which\nare also four in number? \n\nClearly. \nFirst among the virtues found in the State, wisdom comes into view,\nand in this I detect a certain peculiarity. \n\nWhat is that? \nThe State which we have been describing is said to be wise as being\ngood in counsel? \n\nVery true. \nAnd good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge, for not by ignorance,\nbut by knowledge, do men counsel well? \n\nClearly. \nAnd the kinds of knowledge in a State are many and diverse?\n\nOf course. \nThere is the knowledge of the carpenter; but is that the sort of knowledge\nwhich gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel?\n\nCertainly not; that would only give a city the reputation of skill\nin carpentering. \n\nThen a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge\nwhich counsels for the best about wooden implements? \n\nCertainly not. \nNor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots, I said,\nnor as possessing any other similar knowledge? \n\nNot by reason of any of them, he said. \nNor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that\nwould give the city the name of agricultural? \n\nYes. \nWell, I said, and is there any knowledge in our recently founded State\namong any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular\nthing in the State, but about the whole, and considers how a State\ncan best deal with itself and with other States? \n\nThere certainly is. \nAnd what is knowledge, and among whom is it found? I asked.\n\nIt is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and found among\nthose whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.\n\nAnd what is the name which the city derives from the possession of\nthis sort of knowledge? \n\nThe name of good in counsel and truly wise. \nAnd will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more\nsmiths? \n\nThe smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous. \nWill not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive\na name from the profession of some kind of knowledge? \n\nMuch the smallest. \nAnd so by reason of the smallest part or class, and of the knowledge\nwhich resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself, the whole\nState, being thus constituted according to nature, will be wise; and\nthis, which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom, has\nbeen ordained by nature to be of all classes the least. \n\nMost true. \nThus, then, I said, the nature and place in the State of one of the\nfour virtues has somehow or other been discovered. \n\nAnd, in my humble opinion, very satisfactorily discovered, he replied.\n\nAgain, I said, there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage;\nand in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous\nto the State. \n\nHow do you mean? \nWhy, I said, every one who calls any State courageous or cowardly,\nwill be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the\nState's behalf. \n\nNo one, he replied, would ever think of any other. \nCertainly not. \nThe rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but\ntheir courage or cowardice will not, as I conceive, have the effect\nof making the city either the one or the other. \n\nThe city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which\npreserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of\nthings to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated\nthem; and this is what you term courage. \n\nI should like to hear what you are saying once more, for I do not\nthink that I perfectly understand you. \n\nI mean that courage is a kind of salvation. \nSalvation of what? \nOf the opinion respecting things to be feared, what they are and of\nwhat nature, which the law implants through education; and I mean\nby the words 'under all circumstances' to intimate that in pleasure\nor in pain, or under the influence of desire or fear, a man preserves,\nand does not lose this opinion. Shall I give you an illustration?\n\nIf you please. \nYou know, I said, that dyers, when they want to dye wool for making\nthe true sea-purple, begin by selecting their white colour first;\nthis they prepare and dress with much care and pains, in order that\nthe white ground may take the purple hue in full perfection. The dyeing\nthen proceeds; and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast\ncolour, and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away\nthe bloom. But, when the ground has not been duly prepared, you will\nhave noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other\ncolour. \n\nYes, he said; I know that they have a washed-out and ridiculous appearance.\n\nThen now, I said, you will understand what our object was in selecting\nour soldiers, and educating them in music and gymnastic; we were contriving\ninfluences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in\nperfection, and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every\nother opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training,\nnot to be washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure --mightier agent\nfar in washing the soul than any soda or lye; or by sorrow, fear,\nand desire, the mightiest of all other solvents. And this sort of\nuniversal saving power of true opinion in conformity with law about\nreal and false dangers I call and maintain to be courage, unless you\ndisagree. \n\nBut I agree, he replied; for I suppose that you mean to exclude mere\nuninstructed courage, such as that of a wild beast or of a slave --this,\nin your opinion, is not the courage which the law ordains, and ought\nto have another name. \n\nMost certainly. \nThen I may infer courage to be such as you describe? \nWhy, yes, said I, you may, and if you add the words 'of a citizen,'\nyou will not be far wrong; --hereafter, if you like, we will carry\nthe examination further, but at present we are we w seeking not for\ncourage but justice; and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said\nenough. \n\nYou are right, he replied. \nTwo virtues remain to be discovered in the State-first temperance,\nand then justice which is the end of our search. \n\nVery true. \nNow, can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance?\n\nI do not know how that can be accomplished, he said, nor do I desire\nthat justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight\nof; and therefore I wish that you would do me the favour of considering\ntemperance first. \n\nCertainly, I replied, I should not be justified in refusing your request.\n\nThen consider, he said. \nYes, I replied; I will; and as far as I can at present see, the virtue\nof temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than\nthe preceding. \n\nHow so? he asked. \nTemperance, I replied, is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures\nand desires; this is curiously enough implied in the saying of 'a\nman being his own master' and other traces of the same notion may\nbe found in language. \n\nNo doubt, he said. \nThere is something ridiculous in the expression 'master of himself';\nfor the master is also the servant and the servant the master; and\nin all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted.\n\nCertainly. \nThe meaning is, I believe, that in the human soul there is a better\nand also a worse principle; and when the better has the worse under\ncontrol, then a man is said to be master of himself; and this is a\nterm of praise: but when, owing to evil education or association,\nthe better principle, which is also the smaller, is overwhelmed by\nthe greater mass of the worse --in this case he is blamed and is called\nthe slave of self and unprincipled. \n\nYes, there is reason in that. \nAnd now, I said, look at our newly created State, and there you will\nfind one of these two conditions realised; for the State, as you will\nacknowledge, may be justly called master of itself, if the words 'temperance'\nand 'self-mastery' truly express the rule of the better part over\nthe worse. \n\nYes, he said, I see that what you say is true. \nLet me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires\nand pains are generally found in children and women and servants,\nand in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous\nclass. \n\nCertainly, he said. \nWhereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason, and are\nunder the guidance of mind and true opinion, are to be found only\nin a few, and those the best born and best educated. \n\nVery true. These two, as you may perceive, have a place in our State;\nand the meaner desires of the are held down by the virtuous desires\nand wisdom of the few. \n\nThat I perceive, he said. \nThen if there be any city which may be described as master of its\nown pleasures and desires, and master of itself, ours may claim such\na designation? \n\nCertainly, he replied. \nIt may also be called temperate, and for the same reasons?\n\nYes. \nAnd if there be any State in which rulers and subjects will be agreed\nas to the question who are to rule, that again will be our State?\n\nUndoubtedly. \nAnd the citizens being thus agreed among themselves, in which class\nwill temperance be found --in the rulers or in the subjects?\n\nIn both, as I should imagine, he replied. \nDo you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance\nwas a sort of harmony? \n\nWhy so? \nWhy, because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom, each of which\nresides in a part only, the one making the State wise and the other\nvaliant; not so temperance, which extends to the whole, and runs through\nall the notes of the scale, and produces a harmony of the weaker and\nthe stronger and the middle class, whether you suppose them to be\nstronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth, or anything\nelse. Most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of\nthe naturally superior and inferior, as to the right to rule of either,\nboth in states and individuals. \n\nI entirely agree with you. \nAnd so, I said, we may consider three out of the four virtues to have\nbeen discovered in our State. The last of those qualities which make\na state virtuous must be justice, if we only knew what that was.\n\nThe inference is obvious. \nThe time then has arrived, Glaucon, when, like huntsmen, we should\nsurround the cover, and look sharp that justice does not steal away,\nand pass out of sight and escape us; for beyond a doubt she is somewhere\nin this country: watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her,\nand if you see her first, let me know. \n\nWould that I could! but you should regard me rather as a follower\nwho has just eyes enough to, see what you show him --that is about\nas much as I am good for. \n\nOffer up a prayer with me and follow. \nI will, but you must show me the way. \nHere is no path, I said, and the wood is dark and perplexing; still\nwe must push on. \n\nLet us push on. \nHere I saw something: Halloo! I said, I begin to perceive a track,\nand I believe that the quarry will not escape. \n\nGood news, he said. \nTruly, I said, we are stupid fellows. \nWhy so? \nWhy, my good sir, at the beginning of our enquiry, ages ago, there\nwas justice tumbling out at our feet, and we never saw her; nothing\ncould be more ridiculous. Like people who go about looking for what\nthey have in their hands --that was the way with us --we looked not\nat what we were seeking, but at what was far off in the distance;\nand therefore, I suppose, we missed her. \n\nWhat do you mean? \nI mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking\nof justice, and have failed to recognise her. \n\nI grow impatient at the length of your exordium. \nWell then, tell me, I said, whether I am right or not: You remember\nthe original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation\nof the State, that one man should practise one thing only, the thing\nto which his nature was best adapted; --now justice is this principle\nor a part of it. \n\nYes, we often said that one man should do one thing only.\n\nFurther, we affirmed that justice was doing one's own business, and\nnot being a busybody; we said so again and again, and many others\nhave said the same to us. \n\nYes, we said so. \nThen to do one's own business in a certain way may be assumed to be\njustice. Can you tell me whence I derive this inference?\n\nI cannot, but I should like to be told. \nBecause I think that this is the only virtue which remains in the\nState when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom\nare abstracted; and, that this is the ultimate cause and condition\nof the existence of all of them, and while remaining in them is also\ntheir preservative; and we were saying that if the three were discovered\nby us, justice would be the fourth or remaining one. \n\nThat follows of necessity. \nIf we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its\npresence contributes most to the excellence of the State, whether\nthe agreement of rulers and subjects, or the preservation in the soldiers\nof the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers,\nor wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers, or whether this other which\nI am mentioning, and which is found in children and women, slave and\nfreeman, artisan, ruler, subject, --the quality, I mean, of every\none doing his own work, and not being a busybody, would claim the\npalm --the question is not so easily answered. \n\nCertainly, he replied, there would be a difficulty in saying which.\n\nThen the power of each individual in the State to do his own work\nappears to compete with the other political virtues, wisdom, temperance,\ncourage. \n\nYes, he said. \nAnd the virtue which enters into this competition is justice?\n\nExactly. \nLet us look at the question from another point of view: Are not the\nrulers in a State those to whom you would entrust the office of determining\nsuits at law? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither\ntake what is another's, nor be deprived of what is his own?\n\nYes; that is their principle. \nWhich is a just principle? \nYes. \nThen on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and\ndoing what is a man's own, and belongs to him? \n\nVery true. \nThink, now, and say whether you agree with me or not. Suppose a carpenter\nto be doing the business of a cobbler, or a cobbler of a carpenter;\nand suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties, or\nthe same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be the change;\ndo you think that any great harm would result to the State?\n\nNot much. \nBut when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a\ntrader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number\nof his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way\ninto the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators\nand guardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements\nor the duties of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator,\nand warrior all in one, then I think you will agree with me in saying\nthat this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the\nruin of the State. \n\nMost true. \nSeeing then, I said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling\nof one with another, or the change of one into another, is the greatest\nharm to the State, and may be most justly termed evil-doing?\n\nPrecisely. \nAnd the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be termed\nby you injustice? \n\nCertainly. \nThis then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the\nauxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice,\nand will make the city just. \n\nI agree with you. \nWe will not, I said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this\nconception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in\nthe State, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not\nverified, we must have a fresh enquiry. First let us complete the\nold investigation, which we began, as you remember, under the impression\nthat, if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale,\nthere would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual.\nThat larger example appeared to be the State, and accordingly we constructed\nas good a one as we could, knowing well that in the good State justice\nwould be found. Let the discovery which we made be now applied to\nthe individual --if they agree, we shall be satisfied; or, if there\nbe a difference in the individual, we will come back to the State\nand have another trial of the theory. The friction of the two when\nrubbed together may possibly strike a light in which justice will\nshine forth, and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in\nour souls. \n\nThat will be in regular course; let us do as you say. \nI proceeded to ask: When two things, a greater and less, are called\nby the same name, are they like or unlike in so far as they are called\nthe same? \n\nLike, he replied. \nThe just man then, if we regard the idea of justice only, will be\nlike the just State? \n\nHe will. \nAnd a State was thought by us to be just when the three classes in\nthe State severally did their own business; and also thought to be\ntemperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections\nand qualities of these same classes? \n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd so of the individual; we may assume that he has the same three\nprinciples in his own soul which are found in the State; and he may\nbe rightly described in the same terms, because he is affected in\nthe same manner? \n\nCertainly, he said. \nOnce more then, O my friend, we have alighted upon an easy question\n--whether the soul has these three principles or not? \n\nAn easy question! Nay, rather, Socrates, the proverb holds that hard\nis the good. \n\nVery true, I said; and I do not think that the method which we are\nemploying is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question;\nthe true method is another and a longer one. Still we may arrive at\na solution not below the level of the previous enquiry. \n\nMay we not be satisfied with that? he said; --under the circumstances,\nI am quite content. \n\nI too, I replied, shall be extremely well satisfied. \nThen faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said. \nMust we not acknowledge, I said, that in each of us there are the\nsame principles and habits which there are in the State; and that\nfrom the individual they pass into the State? --how else can they\ncome there? Take the quality of passion or spirit; --it would be ridiculous\nto imagine that this quality, when found in States, is not derived\nfrom the individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the Thracians,\nScythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be\nsaid of the love of knowledge, which is the special characteristic\nof our part of the world, or of the love of money, which may, with\nequal truth, be attributed to the Phoenicians and Egyptians.\n\nExactly so, he said. \nThere is no difficulty in understanding this. \nNone whatever. \nBut the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether\nthese principles are three or one; whether, that is to say, we learn\nwith one part of our nature, are angry with another, and with a third\npart desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites; or whether\nthe whole soul comes into play in each sort of action --to determine\nthat is the difficulty. \n\nYes, he said; there lies the difficulty. \nThen let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different.\n\nHow can we? he asked. \nI replied as follows: The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted\nupon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same\ntime, in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this contradiction\noccurs in things apparently the same, we know that they are really\nnot the same, but different. \n\nGood. \nFor example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at\nthe same time in the same part? \n\nImpossible. \nStill, I said, let us have a more precise statement of terms, lest\nwe should hereafter fall out by the way. Imagine the case of a man\nwho is standing and also moving his hands and his head, and suppose\na person to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest\nat the same moment-to such a mode of speech we should object, and\nshould rather say that one part of him is in motion while another\nis at rest. \n\nVery true. \nAnd suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the\nnice distinction that not only parts of tops, but whole tops, when\nthey spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest and\nin motion at the same time (and he may say the same of anything which\nrevolves in the same spot), his objection would not be admitted by\nus, because in such cases things are not at rest and in motion in\nthe same parts of themselves; we should rather say that they have\nboth an axis and a circumference, and that the axis stands still,\nfor there is no deviation from the perpendicular; and that the circumference\ngoes round. But if, while revolving, the axis inclines either to the\nright or left, forwards or backwards, then in no point of view can\nthey be at rest. \n\nThat is the correct mode of describing them, he replied.\n\nThen none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe\nthat the same thing at the same time, in the same part or in relation\nto the same thing, can act or be acted upon in contrary ways.\n\nCertainly not, according to my way of thinking. \nYet, I said, that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections,\nand prove at length that they are untrue, let us assume their absurdity,\nand go forward on the understanding that hereafter, if this assumption\nturn out to be untrue, all the consequences which follow shall be\nwithdrawn. \n\nYes, he said, that will be the best way. \nWell, I said, would you not allow that assent and dissent, desire\nand aversion, attraction and repulsion, are all of them opposites,\nwhether they are regarded as active or passive (for that makes no\ndifference in the fact of their opposition)? \n\nYes, he said, they are opposites. \nWell, I said, and hunger and thirst, and the desires in general, and\nagain willing and wishing, --all these you would refer to the classes\nalready mentioned. You would say --would you not? --that the soul\nof him who desires is seeking after the object of his desires; or\nthat he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess:\nor again, when a person wants anything to be given him, his mind,\nlonging for the realisation of his desires, intimates his wish to\nhave it by a nod of assent, as if he had been asked a question?\n\nVery true. \nAnd what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence\nof desire; should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion\nand rejection? \n\nCertainly. \nAdmitting this to be true of desire generally, let us suppose a particular\nclass of desires, and out of these we will select hunger and thirst,\nas they are termed, which are the most obvious of them? \n\nLet us take that class, he said. \nThe object of one is food, and of the other drink? \nYes. \nAnd here comes the point: is not thirst the desire which the soul\nhas of drink, and of drink only; not of drink qualified by anything\nelse; for example, warm or cold, or much or little, or, in a word,\ndrink of any particular sort: but if the thirst be accompanied by\nheat, then the desire is of cold drink; or, if accompanied by cold,\nthen of warm drink; or, if the thirst be excessive, then the drink\nwhich is desired will be excessive; or, if not great, the quantity\nof drink will also be small: but thirst pure and simple will desire\ndrink pure and simple, which is the natural satisfaction of thirst,\nas food is of hunger? \n\nYes, he said; the simple desire is, as you say, in every case of the\nsimple object, and the qualified desire of the qualified object.\n\nBut here a confusion may arise; and I should wish to guard against\nan opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only,\nbut good drink, or food only, but good food; for good is the universal\nobject of desire, and thirst being a desire, will necessarily be thirst\nafter good drink; and the same is true of every other desire.\n\nYes, he replied, the opponent might have something to say.\n\nNevertheless I should still maintain, that of relatives some have\na quality attached to either term of the relation; others are simple\nand have their correlatives simple. \n\nI do not know what you mean. \nWell, you know of course that the greater is relative to the less?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd the much greater to the much less? \nYes. \nAnd the sometime greater to the sometime less, and the greater that\nis to be to the less that is to be? \n\nCertainly, he said. \nAnd so of more and less, and of other correlative terms, such as the\ndouble and the half, or again, the heavier and the lighter, the swifter\nand the slower; and of hot and cold, and of any other relatives; --is\nnot this true of all of them? \n\nYes. \nAnd does not the same principle hold in the sciences? The object of\nscience is knowledge (assuming that to be the true definition), but\nthe object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge;\nI mean, for example, that the science of house-building is a kind\nof knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and\nis therefore termed architecture. \n\nCertainly. \nBecause it has a particular quality which no other has? \nYes. \nAnd it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular\nkind; and this is true of the other arts and sciences? \n\nYes. \nNow, then, if I have made myself clear, you will understand my original\nmeaning in what I said about relatives. My meaning was, that if one\nterm of a relation is taken alone, the other is taken alone; if one\nterm is qualified, the other is also qualified. I do not mean to say\nthat relatives may not be disparate, or that the science of health\nis healthy, or of disease necessarily diseased, or that the sciences\nof good and evil are therefore good and evil; but only that, when\nthe term science is no longer used absolutely, but has a qualified\nobject which in this case is the nature of health and disease, it\nbecomes defined, and is hence called not merely science, but the science\nof medicine. \n\nI quite understand, and I think as you do. \nWould you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative\nterms, having clearly a relation -- \n\nYes, thirst is relative to drink. \nAnd a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink;\nbut thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little, nor of good\nnor bad, nor of any particular kind of drink, but of drink only?\n\nCertainly. \nThen the soul of the thirsty one, in so far as he is thirsty, desires\nonly drink; for this he yearns and tries to obtain it? \n\nThat is plain. \nAnd if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from\ndrink, that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws\nhim like a beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same thing\ncannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary\nways about the same. \n\nImpossible. \nNo more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull\nthe bow at the same time, but what you say is that one hand pushes\nand the other pulls. \n\nExactly so, he replied. \nAnd might a man be thirsty, and yet unwilling to drink? \nYes, he said, it constantly happens. \nAnd in such a case what is one to say? Would you not say that there\nwas something in the soul bidding a man to drink, and something else\nforbidding him, which is other and stronger than the principle which\nbids him? \n\nI should say so. \nAnd the forbidding principle is derived from reason, and that which\nbids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease? \n\nClearly. \nThen we may fairly assume that they are two, and that they differ\nfrom one another; the one with which man reasons, we may call the\nrational principle of the soul, the other, with which he loves and\nhungers and thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire,\nmay be termed the irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures\nand satisfactions? \n\nYes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.\n\nThen let us finally determine that there are two principles existing\nin the soul. And what of passion, or spirit? Is it a third, or akin\nto one of the preceding? \n\nI should be inclined to say --akin to desire. \nWell, I said, there is a story which I remember to have heard, and\nin which I put faith. The story is, that Leontius, the son of Aglaion,\ncoming up one day from the Piraeus, under the north wall on the outside,\nobserved some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution.\nHe felt a desire to see them, and also a dread and abhorrence of them;\nfor a time he struggled and covered his eyes, but at length the desire\ngot the better of him; and forcing them open, he ran up to the dead\nbodies, saying, Look, ye wretches, take your fill of the fair sight.\n\nI have heard the story myself, he said. \nThe moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire,\nas though they were two distinct things. \n\nYes; that is the meaning, he said. \nAnd are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a\nman's desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself,\nand is angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle,\nwhich is like the struggle of factions in a State, his spirit is on\nthe side of his reason; --but for the passionate or spirited element\nto take part with the desires when reason that she should not be opposed,\nis a sort of thing which thing which I believe that you never observed\noccurring in yourself, nor, as I should imagine, in any one else?\n\nCertainly not. \nSuppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the nobler\nhe is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such\nas hunger, or cold, or any other pain which the injured person may\ninflict upon him --these he deems to be just, and, as I say, his anger\nrefuses to be excited by them. \n\nTrue, he said. \nBut when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils\nand chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice;\nand because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the\nmore determined to persevere and conquer. His noble spirit will not\nbe quelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the\nvoice of the shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.\n\nThe illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our State, as we were\nsaying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of\nthe rulers, who are their shepherds. \n\nI perceive, I said, that you quite understand me; there is, however,\na further point which I wish you to consider. \n\nWhat point? \nYou remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be\na kind of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in\nthe conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational\nprinciple. \n\nMost assuredly. \nBut a further question arises: Is passion different from reason also,\nor only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three principles\nin the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the concupiscent;\nor rather, as the State was composed of three classes, traders, auxiliaries,\ncounsellors, so may there not be in the individual soul a third element\nwhich is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by bad education\nis the natural auxiliary of reason \n\nYes, he said, there must be a third. \nYes, I replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different\nfrom desire, turn out also to be different from reason. \n\nBut that is easily proved: --We may observe even in young children\nthat they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas\nsome of them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of\nthem late enough. \n\nExcellent, I said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals,\nwhich is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. And\nwe may once more appeal to the words of Homer, which have been already\nquoted by us, \n\nHe smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul, for in this verse\nHomer has clearly supposed the power which reasons about the better\nand worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked\nby it. \n\nVery true, he said. \nAnd so, after much tossing, we have reached land, and are fairly agreed\nthat the same principles which exist in the State exist also in the\nindividual, and that they are three in number. \n\nExactly. \nMust we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way,\nand in virtue of the same quality which makes the State wise?\n\nCertainly. \nAlso that the same quality which constitutes courage in the State\nconstitutes courage in the individual, and that both the State and\nthe individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues?\n\nAssuredly. \nAnd the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same\nway in which the State is just? \n\nThat follows, of course. \nWe cannot but remember that the justice of the State consisted in\neach of the three classes doing the work of its own class?\n\nWe are not very likely to have forgotten, he said. \nWe must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities\nof his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own\nwork? \n\nYes, he said, we must remember that too. \nAnd ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care\nof the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle\nto be the subject and ally? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic\nwill bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with\nnoble words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing\nthe wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm? \n\nQuite true, he said. \nAnd these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly\nto know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which\nin each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable\nof gain; over this they will keep guard, lest, waxing great and strong\nwith the fulness of bodily pleasures, as they are termed, the concupiscent\nsoul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave\nand rule those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn\nthe whole life of man? \n\nVery true, he said. \nBoth together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul\nand the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling,\nand the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing\nhis commands and counsels? \n\nTrue. \nAnd he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure\nand in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not\nto fear? \n\nRight, he replied. \nAnd him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules,\nand which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to\nhave a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three\nparts and of the whole? \n\nAssuredly. \nAnd would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements\nin friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and\nthe two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that\nreason ought to rule, and do not rebel? \n\nCertainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether\nin the State or individual. \n\nAnd surely, I said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue\nof what quality a man will be just. \n\nThat is very certain. \nAnd is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different,\nor is she the same which we found her to be in the State?\n\nThere is no difference in my opinion, he said. \nBecause, if any doubt is still lingering in our minds, a few commonplace\ninstances will satisfy us of the truth of what I am saying.\n\nWhat sort of instances do you mean? \nIf the case is put to us, must we not admit that the just State, or\nthe man who is trained in the principles of such a State, will be\nless likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or\nsilver? Would any one deny this? \n\nNo one, he replied. \nWill the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft,\nor treachery either to his friends or to his country? \n\nNever. \nNeither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements?\n\nImpossible. \nNo one will be less likely to commit adultery, or to dishonour his\nfather and mother, or to fall in his religious duties? \n\nNo one. \nAnd the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business,\nwhether in ruling or being ruled? \n\nExactly so. \nAre you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such\nstates is justice, or do you hope to discover some other?\n\nNot I, indeed. \nThen our dream has been realised; and the suspicion which we entertained\nat the beginning of our work of construction, that some divine power\nmust have conducted us to a primary form of justice, has now been\nverified? \n\nYes, certainly. \nAnd the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker\nand the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business, and\nnot another's, was a shadow of justice, and for that reason it was\nof use? \n\nClearly. \nBut in reality justice was such as we were describing, being concerned\nhowever, not with the outward man, but with the inward, which is the\ntrue self and concernment of man: for the just man does not permit\nthe several elements within him to interfere with one another, or\nany of them to do the work of others, --he sets in order his own inner\nlife, and is his own master and his own law, and at peace with himself;\nand when he has bound together the three principles within him, which\nmay be compared to the higher, lower, and middle notes of the scale,\nand the intermediate intervals --when he has bound all these together,\nand is no longer many, but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly\nadjusted nature, then he proceeds to act, if he has to act, whether\nin a matter of property, or in the treatment of the body, or in some\naffair of politics or private business; always thinking and calling\nthat which preserves and co-operates with this harmonious condition,\njust and good action, and the knowledge which presides over it, wisdom,\nand that which at any time impairs this condition, he will call unjust\naction, and the opinion which presides over it ignorance.\n\nYou have said the exact truth, Socrates. \nVery good; and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just\nman and the just State, and the nature of justice in each of them,\nwe should not be telling a falsehood? \n\nMost certainly not. \nMay we say so, then? \nLet us say so. \nAnd now, I said, injustice has to be considered. \nClearly. \nMust not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles\n--a meddlesomeness, and interference, and rising up of a part of the\nsoul against the whole, an assertion of unlawful authority, which\nis made by a rebellious subject against a true prince, of whom he\nis the natural vassal, --what is all this confusion and delusion but\ninjustice, and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance, and every\nform of vice? \n\nExactly so. \nAnd if the nature of justice and injustice be known, then the meaning\nof acting unjustly and being unjust, or, again, of acting justly,\nwill also be perfectly clear? \n\nWhat do you mean? he said. \nWhy, I said, they are like disease and health; being in the soul just\nwhat disease and health are in the body. \n\nHow so? he said. \nWhy, I said, that which is healthy causes health, and that which is\nunhealthy causes disease. \n\nYes. \nAnd just actions cause justice, and unjust actions cause injustice?\n\nThat is certain. \nAnd the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and\ngovernment of one by another in the parts of the body; and the creation\nof disease is the production of a state of things at variance with\nthis natural order? \n\nTrue. \nAnd is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order\nand government of one by another in the parts of the soul, and the\ncreation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance\nwith the natural order? \n\nExactly so, he said. \nThen virtue is the health and beauty and well-being of the soul, and\nvice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same?\n\nTrue. \nAnd do not good practices lead to virtue, and evil practices to vice?\n\nAssuredly. \nStill our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and\ninjustice has not been answered: Which is the more profitable, to\nbe just and act justly and practise virtue, whether seen or unseen\nof gods and men, or to be unjust and act unjustly, if only unpunished\nand unreformed? \n\nIn my judgment, Socrates, the question has now become ridiculous.\nWe know that, when the bodily constitution is gone, life is no longer\nendurable, though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks, and\nhaving all wealth and all power; and shall we be told that when the\nvery essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted, life\nis still worth having to a man, if only he be allowed to do whatever\nhe likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice\nand virtue, or to escape from injustice and vice; assuming them both\nto be such as we have described? \n\nYes, I said, the question is, as you say, ridiculous. Still, as we\nare near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner\nwith our own eyes, let us not faint by the way. \n\nCertainly not, he replied. \nCome up hither, I said, and behold the various forms of vice, those\nof them, I mean, which are worth looking at. \n\nI am following you, he replied: proceed. \nI said, The argument seems to have reached a height from which, as\nfrom some tower of speculation, a man may look down and see that virtue\nis one, but that the forms of vice are innumerable; there being four\nspecial ones which are deserving of note. \n\nWhat do you mean? he said. \nI mean, I replied, that there appear to be as many forms of the soul\nas there are distinct forms of the State. \n\nHow many? \nThere are five of the State, and five of the soul, I said.\n\nWhat are they? \nThe first, I said, is that which we have been describing, and which\nmay be said to have two names, monarchy and aristocracy, accordingly\nas rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many.\n\nTrue, he replied. \nBut I regard the two names as describing one form only; for whether\nthe government is in the hands of one or many, if the governors have\nbeen trained in the manner which we have supposed, the fundamental\nlaws of the State will be maintained. \n\nThat is true, he replied. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK V\n\nSocrates - GLAUCON - ADEIMANTUS \n\nSuch is the good and true City or State, and the good and man is of\nthe same pattern; and if this is right every other is wrong; and the\nevil is one which affects not only the ordering of the State, but\nalso the regulation of the individual soul, and is exhibited in four\nforms. \n\nWhat are they? he said. \nI was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared\nto me to succeed one another, when Pole marchus, who was sitting a\nlittle way off, just beyond Adeimantus, began to whisper to him: stretching\nforth his hand, he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the\nshoulder, and drew him towards him, leaning forward himself so as\nto be quite close and saying something in his ear, of which I only\ncaught the words, 'Shall we let him off, or what shall we do?\n\nCertainly not, said Adeimantus, raising his voice. \nWho is it, I said, whom you are refusing to let off? \nYou, he said. \nI repeated, Why am I especially not to be let off? \nWhy, he said, we think that you are lazy, and mean to cheat us out\nof a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story; and\nyou fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding; as\nif it were self-evident to everybody, that in the matter of women\nand children 'friends have all things in common.' \n\nAnd was I not right, Adeimantus? \nYes, he said; but what is right in this particular case, like everything\nelse, requires to be explained; for community may be of many kinds.\nPlease, therefore, to say what sort of community you mean. We have\nbeen long expecting that you would tell us something about the family\nlife of your citizens --how they will bring children into the world,\nand rear them when they have arrived, and, in general, what is the\nnature of this community of women and children-for we are of opinion\nthat the right or wrong management of such matters will have a great\nand paramount influence on the State for good or for evil. And now,\nsince the question is still undetermined, and you are taking in hand\nanother State, we have resolved, as you heard, not to let you go until\nyou give an account of all this. \n\nTo that resolution, said Glaucon, you may regard me as saying Agreed.\n\nSocrates - ADEIMANTUS - GLAUCON - THRASYMACHUS \n\nAnd without more ado, said Thrasymachus, you may consider us all to\nbe equally agreed. \n\nI said, You know not what you are doing in thus assailing me: What\nan argument are you raising about the State! Just as I thought that\nI had finished, and was only too glad that I had laid this question\nto sleep, and was reflecting how fortunate I was in your acceptance\nof what I then said, you ask me to begin again at the very foundation,\nignorant of what a hornet's nest of words you are stirring. Now I\nforesaw this gathering trouble, and avoided it. \n\nFor what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said Thrasymachus,\n--to look for gold, or to hear discourse? \n\nYes, but discourse should have a limit. \nYes, Socrates, said Glaucon, and the whole of life is the only limit\nwhich wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. But never\nmind about us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your\nown way: What sort of community of women and children is this which\nis to prevail among our guardians? and how shall we manage the period\nbetween birth and education, which seems to require the greatest care?\nTell us how these things will be. \n\nYes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many\nmore doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions.\nFor the practicability of what is said may be doubted; and looked\nat in another point of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable,\nwould be for the best, is also doubtful. Hence I feel a reluctance\nto approach the subject, lest our aspiration, my dear friend, should\nturn out to be a dream only. \n\nFear not, he replied, for your audience will not be hard upon you;\nthey are not sceptical or hostile. \n\nI said: My good friend, I suppose that you mean to encourage me by\nthese words. \n\nYes, he said. \nThen let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse; the encouragement\nwhich you offer would have been all very well had I myself believed\nthat I knew what I was talking about: to declare the truth about matters\nof high interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who\nlove him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind; but to carry\non an argument when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer, which\nis my condition, is a dangerous and slippery thing; and the danger\nis not that I shall be laughed at (of which the fear would be childish),\nbut that I shall miss the truth where I have most need to be sure\nof my footing, and drag my friends after me in my fall. And I pray\nNemesis not to visit upon me the words which I am going to utter.\nFor I do indeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less\ncrime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in\nthe matter of laws. And that is a risk which I would rather run among\nenemies than among friends, and therefore you do well to encourage\nme. \n\nGlaucon laughed and said: Well then, Socrates, in case you and your\nargument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand\nof the and shall not be held to be a deceiver; take courage then and\nspeak. \n\nWell, I said, the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free\nfrom guilt, and what holds at law may hold in argument. \n\nThen why should you mind? \nWell, I replied, I suppose that I must retrace my steps and say what\nI perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. The part\nof the men has been played out, and now properly enough comes the\nturn of the women. Of them I will proceed to speak, and the more readily\nsince I am invited by you. \n\nFor men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my opinion,\nof arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of\nwomen and children is to follow the path on which we originally started,\nwhen we said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of\nthe herd. \n\nTrue. \nLet us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be\nsubject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see\nwhether the result accords with our design. \n\nWhat do you mean? \nWhat I mean may be put into the form of a question, I said: Are dogs\ndivided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting\nand in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust\nto the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks, while we\nleave the females at home, under the idea that the bearing and suckling\ntheir puppies is labour enough for them? \n\nNo, he said, they share alike; the only difference between them is\nthat the males are stronger and the females weaker. \n\nBut can you use different animals for the same purpose, unless they\nare bred and fed in the same way? \n\nYou cannot. \nThen, if women are to have the same duties as men, they must have\nthe same nurture and education? \n\nYes. \nThe education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic.\nYes. \n\nThen women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of\nwar, which they must practise like the men? \n\nThat is the inference, I suppose. \nI should rather expect, I said, that several of our proposals, if\nthey are carried out, being unusual, may appear ridiculous.\n\nNo doubt of it. \nYes, and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women\nnaked in the palaestra, exercising with the men, especially when they\nare no longer young; they certainly will not be a vision of beauty,\nany more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and\nugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia. \n\nYes, indeed, he said: according to present notions the proposal would\nbe thought ridiculous. \n\nBut then, I said, as we have determined to speak our minds, we must\nnot fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this\nsort of innovation; how they will talk of women's attainments both\nin music and gymnastic, and above all about their wearing armour and\nriding upon horseback! \n\nVery true, he replied. \nYet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law;\nat the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life\nto be serious. Not long ago, as we shall remind them, the Hellenes\nwere of the opinion, which is still generally received among the barbarians,\nthat the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper; and when\nfirst the Cretans and then the Lacedaemonians introduced the custom,\nthe wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation.\n\nNo doubt. \nBut when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was\nfar better than to cover them up, and the ludicrous effect to the\noutward eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted,\nthen the man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of\nhis ridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice, or seriously\ninclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of\nthe good. \n\nVery true, he replied. \nFirst, then, whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest,\nlet us come to an understanding about the nature of woman: Is she\ncapable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men,\nor not at all? And is the art of war one of those arts in which she\ncan or can not share? That will be the best way of commencing the\nenquiry, and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion.\n\nThat will be much the best way. \nShall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves;\nin this manner the adversary's position will not be undefended.\n\nWhy not? he said. \nThen let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents. They will\nsay: 'Socrates and Glaucon, no adversary need convict you, for you\nyourselves, at the first foundation of the State, admitted the principle\nthat everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature.' And\ncertainly, if I am not mistaken, such an admission was made by us.\n'And do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed?'\nAnd we shall reply: Of course they do. Then we shall be asked, 'Whether\nthe tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different, and\nsuch as are agreeable to their different natures?' Certainly they\nshould. 'But if so, have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency\nin saying that men and women, whose natures are so entirely different,\nought to perform the same actions?' --What defence will you make for\nus, my good Sir, against any one who offers these objections?\n\nThat is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly; and I\nshall and I do beg of you to draw out the case on our side.\n\nThese are the objections, Glaucon, and there are many others of a\nlike kind, which I foresaw long ago; they made me afraid and reluctant\nto take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women\nand children. \n\nBy Zeus, he said, the problem to be solved is anything but easy.\n\nWhy yes, I said, but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth,\nwhether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid-ocean,\nhe has to swim all the same. \n\nVery true. \nAnd must not we swim and try to reach the shore: we will hope that\nArion's dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us?\n\nI suppose so, he said. \nWell then, let us see if any way of escape can be found. We acknowledged\n--did we not? that different natures ought to have different pursuits,\nand that men's and women's natures are different. And now what are\nwe saying? --that different natures ought to have the same pursuits,\n--this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us. \n\nPrecisely. \nVerily, Glaucon, I said, glorious is the power of the art of contradiction!\n\nWhy do you say so? \nBecause I think that many a man falls into the practice against his\nwill. When he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing,\njust because he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which\nhe is speaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the\nspirit of contention and not of fair discussion. \n\nYes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to\ndo with us and our argument? \n\nA great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally\ninto a verbal opposition. \n\nIn what way? \nWhy, we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that\ndifferent natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never considered\nat all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature, or\nwhy we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different\nnatures and the same to the same natures. \n\nWhy, no, he said, that was never considered by us. \nI said: Suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question\nwhether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and\nhairy men; and if this is admitted by us, then, if bald men are cobblers,\nwe should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers, and conversely?\n\nThat would be a jest, he said. \nYes, I said, a jest; and why? because we never meant when we constructed\nthe State, that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference,\nbut only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which\nthe individual is engaged; we should have argued, for example, that\na physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have\nthe same nature. \n\nTrue. \nWhereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd if, I said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their\nfitness for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or\nart ought to be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference\nconsists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does\nnot amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of\nthe sort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue\nto maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same\npursuits. \n\nVery true, he said. \nNext, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits\nor arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of\na man? \n\nThat will be quite fair. \nAnd perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient\nanswer on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there\nis no difficulty. \n\nYes, perhaps. \nSuppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument, and\nthen we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the\nconstitution of women which would affect them in the administration\nof the State. \n\nBy all means. \nLet us say to him: Come now, and we will ask you a question: --when\nyou spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect, did you\nmean to say that one man will acquire a thing easily, another with\ndifficulty; a little learning will lead the one to discover a great\ndeal; whereas the other, after much study and application, no sooner\nlearns than he forgets; or again, did you mean, that the one has a\nbody which is a good servant to his mind, while the body of the other\nis a hindrance to him?-would not these be the sort of differences\nwhich distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted?\n\nNo one will deny that. \nAnd can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has\nnot all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female?\nNeed I waste time in speaking of the art of weaving, and the management\nof pancakes and preserves, in which womankind does really appear to\nbe great, and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things\nthe most absurd? \n\nYou are quite right, he replied, in maintaining the general inferiority\nof the female sex: although many women are in many things superior\nto many men, yet on the whole what you say is true. \n\nAnd if so, my friend, I said, there is no special faculty of administration\nin a state which a woman has because she is a woman, or which a man\nhas by virtue of his sex, but the gifts of nature are alike diffused\nin both; all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also, but\nin all of them a woman is inferior to a man. \n\nVery true. \nThen are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on\nwomen? \n\nThat will never do. \nOne woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and\nanother has no music in her nature? \n\nVery true. \nAnd one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and\nanother is unwarlike and hates gymnastics? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy;\none has spirit, and another is without spirit? \n\nThat is also true. \nThen one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not.\nWas not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences\nof this sort? \n\nYes. \nMen and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they\ndiffer only in their comparative strength or weakness. \n\nObviously. \nAnd those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the\ncompanions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom\nthey resemble in capacity and in character? \n\nVery true. \nAnd ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?\n\nThey ought. \nThen, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural in assigning\nmusic and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians --to that point\nwe come round again. \n\nCertainly not. \nThe law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, and therefore\nnot an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice,\nwhich prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.\n\nThat appears to be true. \nWe had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and\nsecondly whether they were the most beneficial? \n\nYes. \nAnd the possibility has been acknowledged? \nYes. \nThe very great benefit has next to be established? \nQuite so. \nYou will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian\nwill make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the\nsame? \n\nYes. \nI should like to ask you a question. \nWhat is it? \nWould you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man\nbetter than another? \n\nThe latter. \nAnd in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the\nguardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more\nperfect men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?\n\nWhat a ridiculous question! \nYou have answered me, I replied: Well, and may we not further say\nthat our guardians are the best of our citizens? \n\nBy far the best. \nAnd will not their wives be the best women? \nYes, by far the best. \nAnd can there be anything better for the interests of the State than\nthat the men and women of a State should be as good as possible?\n\nThere can be nothing better. \nAnd this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in\nsuch manner as we have described, will accomplish? \n\nCertainly. \nThen we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest\ndegree beneficial to the State? \n\nTrue. \nThen let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be\ntheir robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence\nof their country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter\nare to be assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in\nother respects their duties are to be the same. And as for the man\nwho laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the best of\nmotives, in his laughter he is plucking \n\nA fruit of unripe wisdom, and he himself is ignorant of what he is\nlaughing at, or what he is about; --for that is, and ever will be,\nthe best of sayings, That the useful is the noble and the hurtful\nis the base. \n\nVery true. \nHere, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may\nsay that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive\nfor enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their\npursuits in common; to the utility and also to the possibility of\nthis arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears\nwitness. \n\nYes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped. \nYes, I said, but a greater is coming; you will of this when you see\nthe next. \n\nGo on; let me see. \nThe law, I said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded,\nis to the following effect, --'that the wives of our guardians are\nto be common, and their children are to be common, and no parent is\nto know his own child, nor any child his parent.' \n\nYes, he said, that is a much greater wave than the other; and the\npossibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable.\n\nI do not think, I said, that there can be any dispute about the very\ngreat utility of having wives and children in common; the possibility\nis quite another matter, and will be very much disputed.\n\nI think that a good many doubts may be raised about both.\n\nYou imply that the two questions must be combined, I replied. Now\nI meant that you should admit the utility; and in this way, as I thought;\nI should escape from one of them, and then there would remain only\nthe possibility. \n\nBut that little attempt is detected, and therefore you will please\nto give a defence of both. \n\nWell, I said, I submit to my fate. Yet grant me a little favour: let\nme feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of\nfeasting themselves when they are walking alone; for before they have\ndiscovered any means of effecting their wishes --that is a matter\nwhich never troubles them --they would rather not tire themselves\nby thinking about possibilities; but assuming that what they desire\nis already granted to them, they proceed with their plan, and delight\nin detailing what they mean to do when their wish has come true --that\nis a way which they have of not doing much good to a capacity which\nwas never good for much. Now I myself am beginning to lose heart,\nand I should like, with your permission, to pass over the question\nof possibility at present. Assuming therefore the possibility of the\nproposal, I shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry\nout these arrangements, and I shall demonstrate that our plan, if\nexecuted, will be of the greatest benefit to the State and to the\nguardians. First of all, then, if you have no objection, I will endeavour\nwith your help to consider the advantages of the measure; and hereafter\nthe question of possibility. \n\nI have no objection; proceed. \nFirst, I think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be\nworthy of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey\nin the one and the power of command in the other; the guardians must\nthemselves obey the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of\nthem in any details which are entrusted to their care. \n\nThat is right, he said. \nYou, I said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will\nnow select the women and give them to them; --they must be as far\nas possible of like natures with them; and they must live in common\nhouses and meet at common meals, None of them will have anything specially\nhis or her own; they will be together, and will be brought up together,\nand will associate at gymnastic exercises. And so they will be drawn\nby a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other\n--necessity is not too strong a word, I think? \n\nYes, he said; --necessity, not geometrical, but another sort of necessity\nwhich lovers know, and which is far more convincing and constraining\nto the mass of mankind. \n\nTrue, I said; and this, Glaucon, like all the rest, must proceed after\nan orderly fashion; in a city of the blessed, licentiousness is an\nunholy thing which the rulers will forbid. \n\nYes, he said, and it ought not to be permitted. \nThen clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the\nhighest degree, and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred?\n\nExactly. \nAnd how can marriages be made most beneficial? --that is a question\nwhich I put to you, because I see in your house dogs for hunting,\nand of the nobler sort of birds not a few. Now, I beseech you, do\ntell me, have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding?\n\nIn what particulars? \nWhy, in the first place, although they are all of a good sort, are\nnot some better than others? \n\nTrue. \nAnd do you breed from them all indifferently, or do you take care\nto breed from the best only? \n\nFrom the best. \nAnd do you take the oldest or the youngest, or only those of ripe\nage? \n\nI choose only those of ripe age. \nAnd if care was not taken in the breeding, your dogs and birds would\ngreatly deteriorate? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd the same of horses and animals in general? \nUndoubtedly. \nGood heavens! my dear friend, I said, what consummate skill will our\nrulers need if the same principle holds of the human species!\n\nCertainly, the same principle holds; but why does this involve any\nparticular skill? \n\nBecause, I said, our rulers will often have to practise upon the body\ncorporate with medicines. Now you know that when patients do not require\nmedicines, but have only to be put under a regimen, the inferior sort\nof practitioner is deemed to be good enough; but when medicine has\nto be given, then the doctor should be more of a man. \n\nThat is quite true, he said; but to what are you alluding?\n\nI mean, I replied, that our rulers will find a considerable dose of\nfalsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects: we\nwere saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines\nmight be of advantage. \n\nAnd we were very right. \nAnd this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the\nregulations of marriages and births. \n\nHow so? \nWhy, I said, the principle has been already laid down that the best\nof either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior\nwith the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear\nthe offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the\nflock is to be maintained in first-rate condition. Now these goings\non must be a secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a\nfurther danger of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking\nout into rebellion. \n\nVery true. \nHad we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring\ntogether the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered\nand suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings\nis a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose\naim will be to preserve the average of population? There are many\nother things which they will have to consider, such as the effects\nof wars and diseases and any similar agencies, in order as far as\nthis is possible to prevent the State from becoming either too large\nor too small. \n\nCertainly, he replied. \nWe shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less\nworthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together, and\nthen they will accuse their own ill-luck and not the rulers.\n\nTo be sure, he said. \nAnd I think that our braver and better youth, besides their other\nhonours and rewards, might have greater facilities of intercourse\nwith women given them; their bravery will be a reason, and such fathers\nought to have as many sons as possible. \n\nTrue. \nAnd the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices\nare to be held by women as well as by men -- \n\nYes -- \nThe proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to\nthe pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses\nwho dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior,\nor of the better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away\nin some mysterious, unknown place, as they should be. \n\nYes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to\nbe kept pure. \n\nThey will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to\nthe fold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible\ncare that no mother recognizes her own child; and other wet-nurses\nmay be engaged if more are required. Care will also be taken that\nthe process of suckling shall not be protracted too long; and the\nmothers will have no getting up at night or other trouble, but will\nhand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and attendants.\n\nYou suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of\nit when they are having children. \n\nWhy, said I, and so they ought. Let us, however, proceed with our\nscheme. We were saying that the parents should be in the prime of\nlife? \n\nVery true. \nAnd what is the prime of life? May it not be defined as a period of\nabout twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?\n\nWhich years do you mean to include? \nA woman, I said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children\nto the State, and continue to bear them until forty; a man may begin\nat five-and-twenty, when he has passed the point at which the pulse\nof life beats quickest, and continue to beget children until he be\nfifty-five. \n\nCertainly, he said, both in men and women those years are the prime\nof physical as well as of intellectual vigour. \n\nAny one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public\nhymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing;\nthe child of which he is the father, if it steals into life, will\nhave been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and\nprayers, which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole\ncity will offer, that the new generation may be better and more useful\nthan their good and useful parents, whereas his child will be the\noffspring of darkness and strange lust. \n\nVery true, he replied. \nAnd the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed\nage who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without\nthe sanction of the rulers; for we shall say that he is raising up\na bastard to the State, uncertified and unconsecrated. \n\nVery true, he replied. \nThis applies, however, only to those who are within the specified\nage: after that we allow them to range at will, except that a man\nmay not marry his daughter or his daughter's daughter, or his mother\nor his mother's mother; and women, on the other hand, are prohibited\nfrom marrying their sons or fathers, or son's son or father's father,\nand so on in either direction. And we grant all this, accompanying\nthe permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may\ncome into being from seeing the light; and if any force a way to the\nbirth, the parents must understand that the offspring of such an union\ncannot be maintained, and arrange accordingly. \n\nThat also, he said, is a reasonable proposition. But how will they\nknow who are fathers and daughters, and so on? \n\nThey will never know. The way will be this: --dating from the day\nof the hymeneal, the bridegroom who was then married will call all\nthe male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards\nhis sons, and the female children his daughters, and they will call\nhim father, and he will call their children his grandchildren, and\nthey will call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers.\nAll who were begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came\ntogether will be called their brothers and sisters, and these, as\nI was saying, will be forbidden to inter-marry. This, however, is\nnot to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of\nbrothers and sisters; if the lot favours them, and they receive the\nsanction of the Pythian oracle, the law will allow them.\n\nQuite right, he replied. \nSuch is the scheme, Glaucon, according to which the guardians of our\nState are to have their wives and families in common. And now you\nwould have the argument show that this community is consistent with\nthe rest of our polity, and also that nothing can be better --would\nyou not? \n\nYes, certainly. \nShall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought\nto be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization\nof a State, --what is the greatest I good, and what is the greatest\nevil, and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp\nof the good or of the evil? \n\nBy all means. \nCan there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality\nwhere unity ought to reign? or any greater good than the bond of unity?\n\nThere cannot. \nAnd there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains\n--where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions\nof joy and sorrow? \n\nNo doubt. \nYes; and where there is no common but only private feeling a State\nis disorganized --when you have one half of the world triumphing and\nthe other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city\nor the citizens? \n\nCertainly. \nSuch differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use\nof the terms 'mine' and 'not mine,' 'his' and 'not his.'\n\nExactly so. \nAnd is not that the best-ordered State in which the greatest number\nof persons apply the terms 'mine' and 'not mine' in the same way to\nthe same thing? \n\nQuite true. \nOr that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the\nindividual --as in the body, when but a finger of one of us is hurt,\nthe whole frame, drawn towards the soul as a center and forming one\nkingdom under the ruling power therein, feels the hurt and sympathizes\nall together with the part affected, and we say that the man has a\npain in his finger; and the same expression is used about any other\npart of the body, which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of\npleasure at the alleviation of suffering. \n\nVery true, he replied; and I agree with you that in the best-ordered\nState there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you\ndescribe. \n\nThen when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil, the\nwhole State will make his case their own, and will either rejoice\nor sorrow with him? \n\nYes, he said, that is what will happen in a well-ordered State.\n\nIt will now be time, I said, for us to return to our State and see\nwhether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental\nprinciples. \n\nVery good. \nOur State like every other has rulers and subjects? \nTrue. \nAll of whom will call one another citizens? \nOf course. \nBut is there not another name which people give to their rulers in\nother States? \n\nGenerally they call them masters, but in democratic States they simply\ncall them rulers. \n\nAnd in our State what other name besides that of citizens do the people\ngive the rulers? \n\nThey are called saviours and helpers, he replied. \nAnd what do the rulers call the people? \nTheir maintainers and foster-fathers. \nAnd what do they call them in other States? \nSlaves. \nAnd what do the rulers call one another in other States?\n\nFellow-rulers. \nAnd what in ours? \nFellow-guardians. \nDid you ever know an example in any other State of a ruler who would\nspeak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not\nbeing his friend? \n\nYes, very often. \nAnd the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest,\nand the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest? \n\nExactly. \nBut would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian\nas a stranger? \n\nCertainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded\nby them either as a brother or sister, or father or mother, or son\nor daughter, or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected\nwith him. \n\nCapital, I said; but let me ask you once more: Shall they be a family\nin name only; or shall they in all their actions be true to the name?\nFor example, in the use of the word 'father,' would the care of a\nfather be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience\nto him which the law commands; and is the violator of these duties\nto be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely\nto receive much good either at the hands of God or of man? Are these\nto be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated\nin their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to\nthem to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk?\n\nThese, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than\nfor them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and\nnot to act in the spirit of them? \n\nThen in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more\noften beard than in any other. As I was describing before, when any\none is well or ill, the universal word will be with me it is well'\nor 'it is ill.' \n\nMost true. \nAnd agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying\nthat they will have their pleasures and pains in common?\n\nYes, and so they will. \nAnd they will have a common interest in the same thing which they\nwill alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will\nhave a common feeling of pleasure and pain? \n\nYes, far more so than in other States. \nAnd the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of\nthe State, will be that the guardians will have a community of women\nand children? \n\nThat will be the chief reason. \nAnd this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as\nwas implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered State to the relation\nof the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?\n\nThat we acknowledged, and very rightly. \nThen the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly\nthe source of the greatest good to the State? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming,\n--that the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other\nproperty; their pay was to be their food, which they were to receive\nfrom the other citizens, and they were to have no private expenses;\nfor we intended them to preserve their true character of guardians.\n\nRight, he replied. \nBoth the community of property and the community of families, as I\nam saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear\nthe city in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each\nman dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house\nof his own, where he has a separate wife and children and private\npleasures and pains; but all will be affected as far as may be by\nthe same pleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about\nwhat is near and dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards\na common end. \n\nCertainly, he replied. \nAnd as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their\nown, suits and complaints will have no existence among them; they\nwill be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children\nor relations are the occasion. \n\nOf course they will. \nNeither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur\namong them. For that equals should defend themselves against equals\nwe shall maintain to be honourable and right; we shall make the protection\nof the person a matter of necessity. \n\nThat is good, he said. \nYes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has\na quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there,\nand not proceed to more dangerous lengths. \n\nCertainly. \nTo the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the\nyounger. \n\nClearly. \nNor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any\nother violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor\nwill he slight him in any way. For there are two guardians, shame\nand fear, mighty to prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from\nlaying hands on those who are to them in the relation of parents;\nfear, that the injured one will be succoured by the others who are\nhis brothers, sons, one wi fathers. \n\nThat is true, he replied. \nThen in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace\nwith one another? \n\nYes, there will be no want of peace. \nAnd as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will\nbe no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against\nthem or against one another. \n\nNone whatever. \nI hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they\nwill be rid, for they are beneath notice: such, for example, as the\nflattery of the rich by the poor, and all the pains and pangs which\nmen experience in bringing up a family, and in finding money to buy\nnecessaries for their household, borrowing and then repudiating, getting\nhow they can, and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves\nto keep --the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this\nway are mean enough and obvious enough, and not worth speaking of.\n\nYes, he said, a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that.\n\nAnd from all these evils they will be delivered, and their life will\nbe blessed as the life of Olympic victors and yet more blessed.\n\nHow so? \nThe Olympic victor, I said, is deemed happy in receiving a part only\nof the blessedness which is secured to our citizens, who have won\na more glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the\npublic cost. For the victory which they have won is the salvation\nof the whole State; and the crown with which they and their children\nare crowned is the fulness of all that life needs; they receive rewards\nfrom the hands of their country while living, and after death have\nan honourable burial. \n\nYes, he said, and glorious rewards they are. \nDo you remember, I said, how in the course of the previous discussion\nsome one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians\nunhappy --they had nothing and might have possessed all things-to\nwhom we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter\nconsider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would\nmake our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the\nState with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular\nclass, but of the whole? \n\nYes, I remember. \nAnd what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out\nto be far better and nobler than that of Olympic victors --is the\nlife of shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be\ncompared with it? \n\nCertainly not. \nAt the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere,\nthat if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner\nthat he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this\nsafe and harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives\nthe best, but infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which\ngets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the whole State to\nhimself, then he will have to learn how wisely Hesiod spoke, when\nhe said, 'half is more than the whole.' \n\nIf he were to consult me, I should say to him: Stay where you are,\nwhen you have the offer of such a life. \n\nYou agree then, I said, that men and women are to have a common way\nof life such as we have described --common education, common children;\nand they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding\nin the city or going out to war; they are to keep watch together,\nand to hunt together like dogs; and always and in all things, as far\nas they are able, women are to share with the men? And in so doing\nthey will do what is best, and will not violate, but preserve the\nnatural relation of the sexes. \n\nI agree with you, he replied. \nThe enquiry, I said, has yet to be made, whether such a community\nbe found possible --as among other animals, so also among men --and\nif possible, in what way possible? \n\nYou have anticipated the question which I was about to suggest.\n\nThere is no difficulty, I said, in seeing how war will be carried\non by them. \n\nHow? \nWhy, of course they will go on expeditions together; and will take\nwith them any of their children who are strong enough, that, after\nthe manner of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which\nthey will have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on\nthey will have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their\nfathers and mothers. Did you never observe in the arts how the potters'\nboys look on and help, long before they touch the wheel?\n\nYes, I have. \nAnd shall potters be more careful in educating their children and\nin giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties\nthan our guardians will be? \n\nThe idea is ridiculous, he said. \nThere is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other\nanimals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive\nto valour. \n\nThat is quite true, Socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which\nmay often happen in war, how great the danger is! the children will\nbe lost as well as their parents, and the State will never recover.\n\nTrue, I said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?\n\nI am far from saying that. \nWell, but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on\nsome occasion when, if they escape disaster, they will be the better\nfor it? \n\nClearly. \nWhether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their\nyouth is a very important matter, for the sake of which some risk\nmay fairly be incurred. \n\nYes, very important. \nThis then must be our first step, --to make our children spectators\nof war; but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against\ndanger; then all will be well. \n\nTrue. \nTheir parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war,\nbut to know, as far as human foresight can, what expeditions are safe\nand what dangerous? \n\nThat may be assumed. \nAnd they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about\nthe dangerous ones? \n\nTrue. \nAnd they will place them under the command of experienced veterans\nwho will be their leaders and teachers? \n\nVery properly. \nStill, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good\ndeal of chance about them? \n\nTrue. \nThen against such chances the children must be at once furnished with\nwings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.\n\nWhat do you mean? he said. \nI mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth,\nand when they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war:\nthe horses must be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and\nyet the swiftest that can be had. In this way they will get an excellent\nview of what is hereafter to be their own business; and if there is\ndanger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape.\n\nI believe that you are right, he said. \nNext, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to\none another and to their enemies? I should be inclined to propose\nthat the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is\nguilty of any other act of cowardice, should be degraded into the\nrank of a husbandman or artisan. What do you think? \n\nBy all means, I should say. \nAnd he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made\na present of to his enemies; he is their lawful prey, and let them\ndo what they like with him. \n\nCertainly. \nBut the hero who has distinguished himself, what shall be done to\nhim? In the first place, he shall receive honour in the army from\nhis youthful comrades; every one of them in succession shall crown\nhim. What do you say? \n\nI approve. \nAnd what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship?\n\nTo that too, I agree. \nBut you will hardly agree to my next proposal. \nWhat is your proposal? \nThat he should kiss and be kissed by them. \nMost certainly, and I should be disposed to go further, and say: Let\nno one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while\nthe expedition lasts. So that if there be a lover in the army, whether\nhis love be youth or maiden, he may be more eager to win the prize\nof valour. \n\nCapital, I said. That the brave man is to have more wives than others\nhas been already determined: and he is to have first choices in such\nmatters more than others, in order that he may have as many children\nas possible? \n\nAgreed. \nAgain, there is another manner in which, according to Homer, brave\nyouths should be honoured; for he tells how Ajax, after he had distinguished\nhimself in battle, was rewarded with long chines, which seems to be\na compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age, being\nnot only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing.\n\nMost true, he said. \nThen in this, I said, Homer shall be our teacher; and we too, at sacrifices\nand on the like occasions, will honour the brave according to the\nmeasure of their valour, whether men or women, with hymns and those\nother distinctions which we were mentioning; also with \n\nseats of precedence, and meats and full cups; and in honouring them,\nwe shall be at the same time training them. \n\nThat, he replied, is excellent. \nYes, I said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say,\nin the first place, that he is of the golden race? \n\nTo be sure. \nNay, have we not the authority of Hesiod for affirming that when they\nare dead \n\nThey are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of\nevil, the guardians of speech-gifted men? \n\nYes; and we accept his authority. \nWe must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine\nand heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction\nand we must do as he bids? \n\nBy all means. \nAnd in ages to come we will reverence them and knee. before their\nsepulchres as at the graves of heroes. And not only they but any who\nare deemed pre-eminently good, whether they die from age, or in any\nother way, shall be admitted to the same honours. \n\nThat is very right, he said. \nNext, how shall our soldiers treat their enemies? What about this?\n\nIn what respect do you mean? \nFirst of all, in regard to slavery? Do you think it right that Hellenes\nshould enslave Hellenic States, or allow others to enslave them, if\nthey can help? Should not their custom be to spare them, considering\nthe danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under\nthe yoke of the barbarians? \n\nTo spare them is infinitely better. \nThen no Hellene should be owned by them as a slave; that is a rule\nwhich they will observe and advise the other Hellenes to observe.\n\nCertainly, he said; they will in this way be united against the barbarians\nand will keep their hands off one another. \n\nNext as to the slain; ought the conquerors, I said, to take anything\nbut their armour? Does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford\nan excuse for not facing the battle? Cowards skulk about the dead,\npretending that they are fulfilling a duty, and many an army before\nnow has been lost from this love of plunder. \n\nVery true. \nAnd is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse, and\nalso a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the\ndead body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting\ngear behind him, --is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at\nhis assailant, quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead?\n\nVery like a dog, he said. \nThen we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial?\n\nYes, he replied, we most certainly must. \nNeither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods, least of\nall the arms of Hellenes, if we care to maintain good feeling with\nother Hellenes; and, indeed, we have reason to fear that the offering\nof spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by\nthe god himself? \n\nVery true. \nAgain, as to the devastation of Hellenic territory or the burning\nof houses, what is to be the practice? \n\nMay I have the pleasure, he said, of hearing your opinion?\n\nBoth should be forbidden, in my judgment; I would take the annual\nproduce and no more. Shall I tell you why? \n\nPray do. \nWhy, you see, there is a difference in the names 'discord' and 'war,'\nand I imagine that there is also a difference in their natures; the\none is expressive of what is internal and domestic, the other of what\nis external and foreign; and the first of the two is termed discord,\nand only the second, war. \n\nThat is a very proper distinction, he replied. \nAnd may I not observe with equal propriety that the Hellenic race\nis all united together by ties of blood and friendship, and alien\nand strange to the barbarians? \n\nVery good, he said. \nAnd therefore when Hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with\nHellenes, they will be described by us as being at war when they fight,\nand by nature enemies, and this kind of antagonism should be called\nwar; but when Hellenes fight with one another we shall say that Hellas\nis then in a state of disorder and discord, they being by nature friends\nand such enmity is to be called discord. \n\nI agree. \nConsider then, I said, when that which we have acknowledged to be\ndiscord occurs, and a city is divided, if both parties destroy the\nlands and burn the houses of one another, how wicked does the strife\nappear! No true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in\npieces his own nurse and mother: There might be reason in the conqueror\ndepriving the conquered of their harvest, but still they would have\nthe idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting\nfor ever. \n\nYes, he said, that is a better temper than the other. \nAnd will not the city, which you are founding, be an Hellenic city?\n\nIt ought to be, he replied. \nThen will not the citizens be good and civilized? \nYes, very civilized. \nAnd will they not be lovers of Hellas, and think of Hellas as their\nown land, and share in the common temples? \n\nMost certainly. \nAnd any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them\nas discord only --a quarrel among friends, which is not to be called\na war? \n\nCertainly not. \nThen they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled?\nCertainly. \n\nThey will use friendly correction, but will not enslave or destroy\ntheir opponents; they will be correctors, not enemies? \n\nJust so. \nAnd as they are Hellenes themselves they will not devastate Hellas,\nnor will they burn houses, not even suppose that the whole population\nof a city --men, women, and children --are equally their enemies,\nfor they know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons\nand that the many are their friends. And for all these reasons they\nwill be unwilling to waste their lands and raze their houses; their\nenmity to them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have\ncompelled the guilty few to give satisfaction? \n\nI agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their Hellenic\nenemies; and with barbarians as the Hellenes now deal with one another.\n\nThen let us enact this law also for our guardians:-that they are neither\nto devastate the lands of Hellenes nor to burn their houses.\n\nAgreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, all our previous\nenactments, are very good. \n\nBut still I must say, Socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in\nthis way you will entirely forget the other question which at the\ncommencement of this discussion you thrust aside: --Is such an order\nof things possible, and how, if at all? For I am quite ready to acknowledge\nthat the plan which you propose, if only feasible, would do all sorts\nof good to the State. I will add, what you have omitted, that your\ncitizens will be the bravest of warriors, and will never leave their\nranks, for they will all know one another, and each will call the\nother father, brother, son; and if you suppose the women to join their\narmies, whether in the same rank or in the rear, either as a terror\nto the enemy, or as auxiliaries in case of need, I know that they\nwill then be absolutely invincible; and there are many domestic tic\nadvantages which might also be mentioned and which I also fully acknowledge:\nbut, as I admit all these advantages and as many more as you please,\nif only this State of yours were to come into existence, we need say\nno more about them; assuming then the existence of the State, let\nus now turn to the question of possibility and ways and means --the\nrest may be left. \n\nIf I loiter for a moment, you instantly make a raid upon me, I said,\nand have no mercy; I have hardly escaped the first and second waves,\nand you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the\nthird, which is the greatest and heaviest. When you have seen and\nheard the third wave, I think you be more considerate and will acknowledge\nthat some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so\nextraordinary as that which I have now to state and investigate.\n\nThe more appeals of this sort which you make, he said, the more determined\nare we that you shall tell us how such a State is possible: speak\nout and at once. \n\nLet me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the\nsearch after justice and injustice. \n\nTrue, he replied; but what of that? \nI was only going to ask whether, if we have discovered them, we are\nto require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice;\nor may we be satisfied with an approximation, and the attainment in\nhim of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men?\n\nThe approximation will be enough. \nWe are enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the\ncharacter of the perfectly just, and into injustice and the perfectly\nunjust, that we might have an ideal. We were to look at these in order\nthat we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according\nto the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled\nthem, but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact.\n\nTrue, he said. \nWould a painter be any the worse because, after having delineated\nwith consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man, he was\nunable to show that any such man could ever have existed?\n\nHe would be none the worse. \nWell, and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect State?\n\nTo be sure. \nAnd is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the\npossibility of a city being ordered in the manner described?\n\nSurely not, he replied. \nThat is the truth, I said. But if, at your request, I am to try and\nshow how and under what conditions the possibility is highest, I must\nask you, having this in view, to repeat your former admissions.\n\nWhat admissions? \nI want to know whether ideals are ever fully realised in language?\nDoes not the word express more than the fact, and must not the actual,\nwhatever a man may think, always, in the nature of things, fall short\nof the truth? What do you say? \n\nI agree. \nThen you must not insist on my proving that the actual State will\nin every respect coincide with the ideal: if we are only able to discover\nhow a city may be governed nearly as we proposed, you will admit that\nwe have discovered the possibility which you demand; and will be contented.\nI am sure that I should be contented --will not you? \n\nYes, I will. \nLet me next endeavour to show what is that fault in States which is\nthe cause of their present maladministration, and what is the least\nchange which will enable a State to pass into the truer form; and\nlet the change, if possible, be of one thing only, or if not, of two;\nat any rate, let the changes be as few and slight as possible.\n\nCertainly, he replied. \nI think, I said, that there might be a reform of the State if only\none change were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a\npossible one. \n\nWhat is it? he said. \nNow then, I said, I go to meet that which I liken to the greatest\nof the waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break\nand drown me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.\n\nProceed. \nI said: Until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of\nthis world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political\ngreatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue\neither to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside,\ncities will never have rest from their evils, --nor the human race,\nas I believe, --and then only will this our State have a possibility\nof life and behold the light of day. Such was the thought, my dear\nGlaucon, which I would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too\nextravagant; for to be convinced that in no other State can there\nbe happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing. \n\nSocrates, what do you mean? I would have you consider that the word\nwhich you have uttered is one at which numerous persons, and very\nrespectable persons too, in a figure pulling off their coats all in\na moment, and seizing any weapon that comes to hand, will run at you\nmight and main, before you know where you are, intending to do heaven\nknows what; and if you don't prepare an answer, and put yourself in\nmotion, you will be prepared by their fine wits,' and no mistake.\n\nYou got me into the scrape, I said. \nAnd I was quite right; however, I will do all I can to get you out\nof it; but I can only give you good-will and good advice, and, perhaps,\nI may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another\n--that is all. And now, having such an auxiliary, you must do your\nbest to show the unbelievers that you are right. \n\nI ought to try, I said, since you offer me such invaluable assistance.\nAnd I think that, if there is to be a chance of our escaping, we must\nexplain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to\nrule in the State; then we shall be able to defend ourselves: There\nwill be discovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy\nand to be leaders in the State; and others who are not born to be\nphilosophers, and are meant to be followers rather than leaders.\n\nThen now for a definition, he said. \nFollow me, I said, and I hope that I may in some way or other be able\nto give you a satisfactory explanation. \n\nProceed. \nI dare say that you remember, and therefore I need not remind you,\nthat a lover, if lie is worthy of the name, ought to show his love,\nnot to some one part of that which he loves, but to the whole.\n\nI really do not understand, and therefore beg of you to assist my\nmemory. \n\nAnother person, I said, might fairly reply as you do; but a man of\npleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower\nof youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover's\nbreast, and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards.\nIs not this a way which you have with the fair: one has a snub nose,\nand you praise his charming face; the hook-nose of another has, you\nsay, a royal look; while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the\ngrace of regularity: the dark visage is manly, the fair are children\nof the gods; and as to the sweet 'honey pale,' as they are called,\nwhat is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives,\nand is not adverse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth?\nIn a word, there is no excuse which you will not make, and nothing\nwhich you will not say, in order not to lose a single flower that\nblooms in the spring-time of youth. \n\nIf you make me an authority in matters of love, for the sake of the\nargument, I assent. \n\nAnd what do you say of lovers of wine? Do you not see them doing the\nsame? They are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine.\n\nVery good. \nAnd the same is true of ambitious men; if they cannot command an army,\nthey are willing to command a file; and if they cannot be honoured\nby really great and important persons, they are glad to be honoured\nby lesser and meaner people, but honour of some kind they must have.\n\nExactly. \nOnce more let me ask: Does he who desires any class of goods, desire\nthe whole class or a part only? \n\nThe whole. \nAnd may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover, not of a\npart of wisdom only, but of the whole? \n\nYes, of the whole. \nAnd he who dislikes learnings, especially in youth, when he has no\npower of judging what is good and what is not, such an one we maintain\nnot to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge, just as he who refuses\nhis food is not hungry, and may be said to have a bad appetite and\nnot a good one? \n\nVery true, he said. \nWhereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is\ncurious to learn and is never satisfied, may be justly termed a philosopher?\nAm I not right? \n\nGlaucon said: If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many\na strange being will have a title to the name. All the lovers of sights\nhave a delight in learning, and must therefore be included. Musical\namateurs, too, are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers,\nfor they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything\nlike a philosophical discussion, if they could help, while they run\nabout at the Dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears\nto hear every chorus; whether the performance is in town or country\n--that makes no difference --they are there. Now are we to maintain\nthat all these and any who have similar tastes, as well as the professors\nof quite minor arts, are philosophers? \n\nCertainly not, I replied; they are only an imitation. \nHe said: Who then are the true philosophers? \nThose, I said, who are lovers of the vision of truth. \nThat is also good, he said; but I should like to know what you mean?\n\nTo another, I replied, I might have a difficulty in explaining; but\nI am sure that you will admit a proposition which I am about to make.\n\nWhat is the proposition? \nThat since beauty is the opposite of ugliness, they are two?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd inasmuch as they are two, each of them is one? \nTrue again. \nAnd of just and unjust, good and evil, and of every other class, the\nsame remark holds: taken singly, each of them one; but from the various\ncombinations of them with actions and things and with one another,\nthey are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many? Very true.\n\nAnd this is the distinction which I draw between the sight-loving,\nart-loving, practical class and those of whom I am speaking, and who\nare alone worthy of the name of philosophers. \n\nHow do you distinguish them? he said. \nThe lovers of sounds and sights, I replied, are, as I conceive, fond\nof fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products\nthat are made out of them, but their mind is incapable of seeing or\nloving absolute beauty. \n\nTrue, he replied. \nFew are they who are able to attain to the sight of this.\n\nVery true. \nAnd he who, having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute\nbeauty, or who, if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty\nis unable to follow --of such an one I ask, Is he awake or in a dream\nonly? Reflect: is not the dreamer, sleeping or waking, one who likens\ndissimilar things, who puts the copy in the place of the real object?\n\nI should certainly say that such an one was dreaming. \nBut take the case of the other, who recognises the existence of absolute\nbeauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which\nparticipate in the idea, neither putting the objects in the place\nof the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects --is he a dreamer,\nor is he awake? \n\nHe is wide awake. \nAnd may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge,\nand that the mind of the other, who opines only, has opinion\n\nCertainly. \nBut suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our\nstatement, can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him,\nwithout revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits?\n\nWe must certainly offer him some good advice, he replied.\n\nCome, then, and let us think of something to say to him. Shall we\nbegin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he\nmay have, and that we are rejoiced at his having it? But we should\nlike to ask him a question: Does he who has knowledge know something\nor nothing? (You must answer for him.) \n\nI answer that he knows something. \nSomething that is or is not? \nSomething that is; for how can that which is not ever be known?\n\nAnd are we assured, after looking at the matter from many points of\nview, that absolute being is or may be absolutely known, but that\nthe utterly non-existent is utterly unknown? \n\nNothing can be more certain. \nGood. But if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be\nand not to be, that will have a place intermediate between pure being\nand the absolute negation of being? \n\nYes, between them. \nAnd, as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity\nto not-being, for that intermediate between being and not-being there\nhas to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance\nand knowledge, if there be such? \n\nCertainly. \nDo we admit the existence of opinion? \nUndoubtedly. \nAs being the same with knowledge, or another faculty? \nAnother faculty. \nThen opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter\ncorresponding to this difference of faculties? \n\nYes. \nAnd knowledge is relative to being and knows being. But before I proceed\nfurther I will make a division. \n\nWhat division? \nI will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves: they are\npowers in us, and in all other things, by which we do as we do. Sight\nand hearing, for example, I should call faculties. Have I clearly\nexplained the class which I mean? \n\nYes, I quite understand. \nThen let me tell you my view about them. I do not see them, and therefore\nthe distinctions of fire, colour, and the like, which enable me to\ndiscern the differences of some things, do not apply to them. In speaking\nof a faculty I think only of its sphere and its result; and that which\nhas the same sphere and the same result I call the same faculty, but\nthat which has another sphere and another result I call different.\nWould that be your way of speaking? \n\nYes. \nAnd will you be so very good as to answer one more question? Would\nyou say that knowledge is a faculty, or in what class would you place\nit? \n\nCertainly knowledge is a faculty, and the mightiest of all faculties.\n\nAnd is opinion also a faculty? \nCertainly, he said; for opinion is that with which we are able to\nform an opinion. \n\nAnd yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is\nnot the same as opinion? \n\nWhy, yes, he said: how can any reasonable being ever identify that\nwhich is infallible with that which errs? \n\nAn excellent answer, proving, I said, that we are quite conscious\nof a distinction between them. \n\nYes. \nThen knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct\nspheres or subject-matters? \n\nThat is certain. \nBeing is the sphere or subject-matter of knowledge, and knowledge\nis to know the nature of being? \n\nYes. \nAnd opinion is to have an opinion? \nYes. \nAnd do we know what we opine? or is the subject-matter of opinion\nthe same as the subject-matter of knowledge? \n\nNay, he replied, that has been already disproven; if difference in\nfaculty implies difference in the sphere or subject matter, and if,\nas we were saying, opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties, then\nthe sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same.\n\nThen if being is the subject-matter of knowledge, something else must\nbe the subject-matter of opinion? \n\nYes, something else. \nWell then, is not-being the subject-matter of opinion? or, rather,\nhow can there be an opinion at all about not-being? Reflect: when\na man has an opinion, has he not an opinion about something? Can he\nhave an opinion which is an opinion about nothing? \n\nImpossible. \nHe who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing?\n\nYes. \nAnd not-being is not one thing but, properly speaking, nothing?\n\nTrue. \nOf not-being, ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative;\nof being, knowledge? \n\nTrue, he said. \nThen opinion is not concerned either with being or with not-being?\n\nNot with either. \nAnd can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge? \nThat seems to be true. \nBut is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them, in\na greater clearness than knowledge, or in a greater darkness than\nignorance? \n\nIn neither. \nThen I suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge,\nbut lighter than ignorance? \n\nBoth; and in no small degree. \nAnd also to be within and between them? \nYes. \nThen you would infer that opinion is intermediate? \nNo question. \nBut were we not saying before, that if anything appeared to be of\na sort which is and is not at the same time, that sort of thing would\nappear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute\nnot-being; and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge\nnor ignorance, but will be found in the interval between them?\n\nTrue. \nAnd in that interval there has now been discovered something which\nwe call opinion? \n\nThere has. \nThen what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally\nof the nature of being and not-being, and cannot rightly be termed\neither, pure and simple; this unknown term, when discovered, we may\ntruly call the subject of opinion, and assign each to its proper faculty,\n-the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the\nfaculty of the mean. \n\nTrue. \nThis being premised, I would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that\nthere is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty --in whose opinion\nthe beautiful is the manifold --he, I say, your lover of beautiful\nsights, who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one, and\nthe just is one, or that anything is one --to him I would appeal,\nsaying, Will you be so very kind, sir, as to tell us whether, of all\nthese beautiful things, there is one which will not be found ugly;\nor of the just, which will not be found unjust; or of the holy, which\nwill not also be unholy? \n\nNo, he replied; the beautiful will in some point of view be found\nugly; and the same is true of the rest. \n\nAnd may not the many which are doubles be also halves? --doubles,\nthat is, of one thing, and halves of another? \n\nQuite true. \nAnd things great and small, heavy and light, as they are termed, will\nnot be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names?\n\nTrue; both these and the opposite names will always attach to all\nof them. \n\nAnd can any one of those many things which are called by particular\nnames be said to be this rather than not to be this? \n\nHe replied: They are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts\nor the children's puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat, with\nwhat he hit him, as they say in the puzzle, and upon what the bat\nwas sitting. The individual objects of which I am speaking are also\na riddle, and have a double sense: nor can you fix them in your mind,\neither as being or not-being, or both, or neither. \n\nThen what will you do with them? I said. Can they have a better place\nthan between being and not-being? For they are clearly not in greater\ndarkness or negation than not-being, or more full of light and existence\nthan being. \n\nThat is quite true, he said. \nThus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the\nmultitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things\nare tossing about in some region which is halfway between pure being\nand pure not-being? \n\nWe have. \nYes; and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we\nmight find was to be described as matter of opinion, and not as matter\nof knowledge; being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained\nby the intermediate faculty. \n\nQuite true. \nThen those who see the many beautiful, and who yet neither see absolute\nbeauty, nor can follow any guide who points the way thither; who see\nthe many just, and not absolute justice, and the like, --such persons\nmay be said to have opinion but not knowledge? \n\nThat is certain. \nBut those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said\nto know, and not to have opinion only? \n\nNeither can that be denied. \nThe one loves and embraces the subjects of knowledge, the other those\nof opinion? The latter are the same, as I dare say will remember,\nwho listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours, but would\nnot tolerate the existence of absolute beauty. \n\nYes, I remember. \nShall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers\nof opinion rather than lovers of wisdom, and will they be very angry\nwith us for thus describing them? \n\nI shall tell them not to be angry; no man should be angry at what\nis true. \n\nBut those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers\nof wisdom and not lovers of opinion. \n\nAssuredly. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VI\n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nAnd thus, Glaucon, after the argument has gone a weary way, the true\nand the false philosophers have at length appeared in view.\n\nI do not think, he said, that the way could have been shortened.\n\nI suppose not, I said; and yet I believe that we might have had a\nbetter view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined\nto this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting\nus, which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just\ndiffers from that of the unjust must consider. \n\nAnd what is the next question? he asked. \nSurely, I said, the one which follows next in order. Inasmuch as philosophers\nonly are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable, and those who\nwander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers,\nI must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our\nState? \n\nAnd how can we rightly answer that question? \nWhichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions\nof our State --let them be our guardians. \n\nVery good. \nNeither, I said, can there be any question that the guardian who is\nto keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes? \n\nThere can be no question of that. \nAnd are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge\nof the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear\npattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute\ntruth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of\nthe other world to order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice\nin this, if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order\nof them --are not such persons, I ask, simply blind? \n\nTruly, he replied, they are much in that condition. \nAnd shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides\nbeing their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular\nof virtue, also know the very truth of each thing? \n\nThere can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this\ngreatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place\nunless they fail in some other respect. \n\nSuppose then, I said, that we determine how far they can unite this\nand the other excellences. \n\nBy all means. \nIn the first place, as we began by observing, the nature of the philosopher\nhas to be ascertained. We must come to an understanding about him,\nand, when we have done so, then, if I am not mistaken, we shall also\nacknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible, and that\nthose in whom they are united, and those only, should be rulers in\nthe State. \n\nWhat do you mean? \nLet us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a\nsort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation\nand corruption. \n\nAgreed. \nAnd further, I said, let us agree that they are lovers of all true\nbeing; there is no part whether greater or less, or more or less honourable,\nwhich they are willing to renounce; as we said before of the lover\nand the man of ambition. \n\nTrue. \nAnd if they are to be what we were describing, is there not another\nquality which they should also possess? \n\nWhat quality? \nTruthfulness: they will never intentionally receive into their mind\nfalsehood, which is their detestation, and they will love the truth.\n\nYes, that may be safely affirmed of them. \n'May be,' my friend, I replied, is not the word; say rather 'must\nbe affirmed:' for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help\nloving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections.\n\nRight, he said. \nAnd is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth? \nHow can there be? \nCan the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood?\n\nNever. \nThe true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth, as far\nas in him lies, desire all truth? \n\nAssuredly. \nBut then again, as we know by experience, he whose desires are strong\nin one direction will have them weaker in others; they will be like\na stream which has been drawn off into another channel. \n\nTrue. \nHe whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be\nabsorbed in the pleasures of the soul, and will hardly feel bodily\npleasure --I mean, if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one.\n\nThat is most certain. \nSuch an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous; for\nthe motives which make another man desirous of having and spending,\nhave no place in his character. \n\nVery true. \nAnother criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered.\n\nWhat is that? \nThere should be no secret corner of illiberality; nothing can more\nantagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the\nwhole of things both divine and human. \n\nMost true, he replied. \nThen how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator\nof all time and all existence, think much of human life?\n\nHe cannot. \nOr can such an one account death fearful? \nNo indeed. \nThen the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy?\n\nCertainly not. \nOr again: can he who is harmoniously constituted, who is not covetous\nor mean, or a boaster, or a coward-can he, I say, ever be unjust or\nhard in his dealings? \n\nImpossible. \nThen you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle, or rude\nand unsociable; these are the signs which distinguish even in youth\nthe philosophical nature from the unphilosophical. \n\nTrue. \nThere is another point which should be remarked. \nWhat point? \nWhether he has or has not a pleasure in learning; for no one will\nlove that which gives him pain, and in which after much toil he makes\nlittle progress. \n\nCertainly not. \nAnd again, if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns,\nwill he not be an empty vessel? \n\nThat is certain. \nLabouring in vain, he must end in hating himself and his fruitless\noccupation? Yes. \n\nThen a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic\nnatures; we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd once more, the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend\nto disproportion? \n\nUndoubtedly. \nAnd do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion?\n\nTo proportion. \nThen, besides other qualities, we must try to find a naturally well-proportioned\nand gracious mind, which will move spontaneously towards the true\nbeing of everything. \n\nCertainly. \nWell, and do not all these qualities, which we have been enumerating,\ngo together, and are they not, in a manner, necessary to a soul, which\nis to have a full and perfect participation of being? \n\nThey are absolutely necessary, he replied. \nAnd must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who\nhas the gift of a good memory, and is quick to learn, --noble, gracious,\nthe friend of truth, justice, courage, temperance, who are his kindred?\n\nThe god of jealousy himself, he said, could find no fault with such\na study. \n\nAnd to men like him, I said, when perfected by years and education,\nand to these only you will entrust the State. \n\nSocrates - ADEIMANTUS \n\nHere Adeimantus interposed and said: To these statements, Socrates,\nno one can offer a reply; but when you talk in this way, a strange\nfeeling passes over the minds of your hearers: They fancy that they\nare led astray a little at each step in the argument, owing to their\nown want of skill in asking and answering questions; these littles\naccumulate, and at the end of the discussion they are found to have\nsustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to\nbe turned upside down. And as unskilful players of draughts are at\nlast shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to\nmove, so they too find themselves shut up at last; for they have nothing\nto say in this new game of which words are the counters; and yet all\nthe time they are in the right. The observation is suggested to me\nby what is now occurring. For any one of us might say, that although\nin words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument,\nhe sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy, when they carry\non the study, not only in youth as a part of education, but as the\npursuit of their maturer years, most of them become strange monsters,\nnot to say utter rogues, and that those who may be considered the\nbest of them are made useless to the world by the very study which\nyou extol. \n\nWell, and do you think that those who say so are wrong? \nI cannot tell, he replied; but I should like to know what is your\nopinion. \n\nHear my answer; I am of opinion that they are quite right.\n\nThen how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease\nfrom evil until philosophers rule in them, when philosophers are acknowledged\nby us to be of no use to them? \n\nYou ask a question, I said, to which a reply can only be given in\na parable. \n\nYes, Socrates; and that is a way of speaking to which you are not\nat all accustomed, I suppose. \n\nI perceive, I said, that you are vastly amused at having plunged me\ninto such a hopeless discussion; but now hear the parable, and then\nyou will be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination:\nfor the manner in which the best men are treated in their own States\nis so grievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it;\nand therefore, if I am to plead their cause, I must have recourse\nto fiction, and put together a figure made up of many things, like\nthe fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures.\nImagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is\ntaller and stronger than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf\nand has a similar infirmity in sight, and his knowledge of navigation\nis not much better. The sailors are quarrelling with one another about\nthe steering --every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer,\nthough he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell\nwho taught him or when he learned, and will further assert that it\ncannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who\nsays the contrary. They throng about the captain, begging and praying\nhim to commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail,\nbut others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them\noverboard, and having first chained up the noble captain's senses\nwith drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession\nof the ship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking,\nthey proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected\nof them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their\nplot for getting the ship out of the captain's hands into their own\nwhether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor,\npilot, able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call\na good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to\nthe year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else\nbelongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command\nof a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other\npeople like or not-the possibility of this union of authority with\nthe steerer's art has never seriously entered into their thoughts\nor been made part of their calling. Now in vessels which are in a\nstate of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true\npilot be regarded? Will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer,\na good-for-nothing? \n\nOf course, said Adeimantus. \nThen you will hardly need, I said, to hear the interpretation of the\nfigure, which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the\nState; for you understand already. \n\nCertainly. \nThen suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised\nat finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities; explain\nit to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be\nfar more extraordinary. \n\nI will. \nSay to him, that, in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be\nuseless to the rest of the world, he is right; but also tell him to\nattribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use\nthem, and not to themselves. The pilot should not humbly beg the sailors\nto be commanded by him --that is not the order of nature; neither\nare 'the wise to go to the doors of the rich' --the ingenious author\nof this saying told a lie --but the truth is, that, when a man is\nill, whether he be rich or poor, to the physician he must go, and\nhe who wants to be governed, to him who is able to govern. The ruler\nwho is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled\nby him; although the present governors of mankind are of a different\nstamp; they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors, and the\ntrue helmsmen to those who are called by them good-for-nothings and\nstar-gazers. \n\nPrecisely so, he said. \nFor these reasons, and among men like these, philosophy, the noblest\npursuit of all, is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the\nopposite faction; not that the greatest and most lasting injury is\ndone to her by her opponents, but by her own professing followers,\nthe same of whom you suppose the accuser to say, that the greater\nnumber of them are arrant rogues, and the best are useless; in which\nopinion I agreed. \n\nYes. \nAnd the reason why the good are useless has now been explained?\n\nTrue. \nThen shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority\nis also unavoidable, and that this is not to be laid to the charge\nof philosophy any more than the other? \n\nBy all means. \nAnd let us ask and answer in turn, first going back to the description\nof the gentle and noble nature. Truth, as you will remember, was his\nleader, whom he followed always and in all things; failing in this,\nhe was an impostor, and had no part or lot in true philosophy.\n\nYes, that was said. \nWell, and is not this one quality, to mention no others, greatly at\nvariance with present notions of him? \n\nCertainly, he said. \nAnd have we not a right to say in his defence, that the true lover\nof knowledge is always striving after being --that is his nature;\nhe will not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance\nonly, but will go on --the keen edge will not be blunted, nor the\nforce of his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of\nthe true nature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power\nin the soul, and by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming\nincorporate with very being, having begotten mind and truth, he will\nhave knowledge and will live and grow truly, and then, and not till\nthen, will he cease from his travail. \n\nNothing, he said, can be more just than such a description of him.\n\nAnd will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher's nature?\nWill he not utterly hate a lie? \n\nHe will. \nAnd when truth is the captain, we cannot suspect any evil of the band\nwhich he leads? \n\nImpossible. \nJustice and health of mind will be of the company, and temperance\nwill follow after? \n\nTrue, he replied. \nNeither is there any reason why I should again set in array the philosopher's\nvirtues, as you will doubtless remember that courage, magnificence,\napprehension, memory, were his natural gifts. And you objected that,\nalthough no one could deny what I then said, still, if you leave words\nand look at facts, the persons who are thus described are some of\nthem manifestly useless, and the greater number utterly depraved;\nwe were then led to enquire into the grounds of these accusations,\nand have now arrived at the point of asking why are the majority bad,\nwhich question of necessity brought us back to the examination and\ndefinition of the true philosopher. \n\nExactly. \nAnd we have next to consider the of the philosophic nature, why so\nmany are spoiled and so few escape spoiling --I am speaking of those\nwho were said to be useless but not wicked --and, when we have done\nwith them, we will speak of the imitators of philosophy, what manner\nof men are they who aspire after a profession which is above them\nand of which they are unworthy, and then, by their manifold inconsistencies,\nbring upon philosophy, and upon all philosophers, that universal reprobation\nof which we speak. \n\nWhat are these corruptions? he said. \nI will see if I can explain them to you. Every one will admit that\na nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required\nin a philosopher, is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men.\n\nRare indeed. \nAnd what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare\nnatures! \n\nWhat causes? \nIn the first place there are their own virtues, their courage, temperance,\nand the rest of them, every one of which praise worthy qualities (and\nthis is a most singular circumstance) destroys and distracts from\nphilosophy the soul which is the possessor of them. \n\nThat is very singular, he replied. \nThen there are all the ordinary goods of life --beauty, wealth, strength,\nrank, and great connections in the State --you understand the sort\nof things --these also have a corrupting and distracting effect.\n\nI understand; but I should like to know more precisely what you mean\nabout them. \n\nGrasp the truth as a whole, I said, and in the right way; you will\nthen have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks, and\nthey will no longer appear strange to you. \n\nAnd how am I to do so? he asked. \nWhy, I said, we know that all germs or seeds, whether vegetable or\nanimal, when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or\nsoil, in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to\nthe want of a suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to\nwhat is good than what is not. \n\nVery true. \nThere is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien\nconditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast\nis greater. \n\nCertainly. \nAnd may we not say, Adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they\nare ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? Do not great crimes and\nthe spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by\neducation rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are\nscarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?\n\nThere I think that you are right. \nAnd our philosopher follows the same analogy-he is like a plant which,\nhaving proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue,\nbut, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most noxious\nof all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. Do you\nreally think, as people so often say, that our youth are corrupted\nby Sophists, or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any\ndegree worth speaking of? Are not the public who say these things\nthe greatest of all Sophists? And do they not educate to perfection\nyoung and old, men and women alike, and fashion them after their own\nhearts? \n\nWhen is this accomplished? he said. \nWhen they meet together, and the world sits down at an assembly, or\nin a court of law, or a theatre, or a camp, or in any other popular\nresort, and there is a great uproar, and they praise some things which\nare being said or done, and blame other things, equally exaggerating\nboth, shouting and clapping their hands, and the echo of the rocks\nand the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the\npraise or blame --at such a time will not a young man's heart, as\nthey say, leap within him? Will any private training enable him to\nstand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion? or will\nhe be carried away by the stream? Will he not have the notions of\ngood and evil which the public in general have --he will do as they\ndo, and as they are, such will he be? \n\nYes, Socrates; necessity will compel him. \nAnd yet, I said, there is a still greater necessity, which has not\nbeen mentioned. \n\nWhat is that? \nThe gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which, as you\nare aware, these new Sophists and educators who are the public, apply\nwhen their words are powerless. \n\nIndeed they do; and in right good earnest. \nNow what opinion of any other Sophist, or of any private person, can\nbe expected to overcome in such an unequal contest? \n\nNone, he replied. \nNo, indeed, I said, even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly;\nthere neither is, nor has been, nor is ever likely to be, any different\ntype of character which has had no other training in virtue but that\nwhich is supplied by public opinion --I speak, my friend, of human\nvirtue only; what is more than human, as the proverb says, is not\nincluded: for I would not have you ignorant that, in the present evil\nstate of governments, whatever is saved and comes to good is saved\nby the power of God, as we may truly say. \n\nI quite assent, he replied. \nThen let me crave your assent also to a further observation.\n\nWhat are you going to say? \nWhy, that all those mercenary individuals, whom the many call Sophists\nand whom they deem to be their adversaries, do, in fact, teach nothing\nbut the opinion of the many, that is to say, the opinions of their\nassemblies; and this is their wisdom. I might compare them to a man\nwho should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast\nwho is fed by him-he would learn how to approach and handle him, also\nat what times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse,\nand what is the meaning of his several cries, and by what sounds,\nwhen another utters them, he is soothed or infuriated; and you may\nsuppose further, that when, by continually attending upon him, he\nhas become perfect in all this, he calls his knowledge wisdom, and\nmakes of it a system or art, which he proceeds to teach, although\nhe has no real notion of what he means by the principles or passions\nof which he is speaking, but calls this honourable and that dishonourable,\nor good or evil, or just or unjust, all in accordance with the tastes\nand tempers of the great brute. Good he pronounces to be that in which\nthe beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes; and he can\ngive no other account of them except that the just and noble are the\nnecessary, having never himself seen, and having no power of explaining\nto others the nature of either, or the difference between them, which\nis immense. By heaven, would not such an one be a rare educator?\n\nIndeed, he would. \nAnd in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment\nof the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude, whether in painting\nor music, or, finally, in politics, differ from him whom I have been\ndescribing For when a man consorts with the many, and exhibits to\nthem his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done\nthe State, making them his judges when he is not obliged, the so-called\nnecessity of Diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise.\nAnd yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation\nof their own notions about the honourable and good. Did you ever hear\nany of them which were not? \n\nNo, nor am I likely to hear. \nYou recognise the truth of what I have been saying? Then let me ask\nyou to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to\nbelieve in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many\nbeautiful, or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many\nin each kind? \n\nCertainly not. \nThen the world cannot possibly be a philosopher? \nImpossible. \nAnd therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure\nof the world? \n\nThey must. \nAnd of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them?\n\nThat is evident. \nThen, do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved\nin his calling to the end? and remember what we were saying of him,\nthat he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence\n--these were admitted by us to be the true philosopher's gifts.\n\nYes. \nWill not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first\namong all, especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental\nones? \n\nCertainly, he said. \nAnd his friends and fellow-citizens will want to use him as he gets\nolder for their own purposes? \n\nNo question. \nFalling at his feet, they will make requests to him and do him honour\nand flatter him, because they want to get into their hands now, the\npower which he will one day possess. \n\nThat often happens, he said. \nAnd what will a man such as he be likely to do under such circumstances,\nespecially if he be a citizen of a great city, rich and noble, and\na tall proper youth? Will he not be full of boundless aspirations,\nand fancy himself able to manage the affairs of Hellenes and of barbarians,\nand having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate\nhimself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride?\n\nTo be sure he will. \nNow, when he is in this state of mind, if some one gently comes to\nhim and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding, which\ncan only be got by slaving for it, do you think that, under such adverse\ncircumstances, he will be easily induced to listen? \n\nFar otherwise. \nAnd even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural\nreasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and\ntaken captive by philosophy, how will his friends behave when they\nthink that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping\nto reap from his companionship? Will they not do and say anything\nto prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his\nteacher powerless, using to this end private intrigues as well as\npublic prosecutions? \n\nThere can be no doubt of it. \nAnd how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher?\n\nImpossible. \nThen were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which\nmake a man a philosopher may, if he be ill-educated, divert him from\nphilosophy, no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other\nso-called goods of life? \n\nWe were quite right. \nThus, my excellent friend, is brought about all that ruin and failure\nwhich I have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best\nof all pursuits; they are natures which we maintain to be rare at\nany time; this being the class out of which come the men who are the\nauthors of the greatest evil to States and individuals; and also of\nthe greatest good when the tide carries them in that direction; but\na small man never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals\nor to States. \n\nThat is most true, he said. \nAnd so philosophy is left desolate, with her marriage rite incomplete:\nfor her own have fallen away and forsaken her, and while they are\nleading a false and unbecoming life, other unworthy persons, seeing\nthat she has no kinsmen to be her protectors, enter in and dishonour\nher; and fasten upon her the reproaches which, as you say, her reprovers\nutter, who affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing,\nand that the greater number deserve the severest punishment.\n\nThat is certainly what people say. \nYes; and what else would you expect, I said, when you think of the\npuny creatures who, seeing this land open to them --a land well stocked\nwith fair names and showy titles --like prisoners running out of prison\ninto a sanctuary, take a leap out of their trades into philosophy;\nthose who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable\ncrafts? For, although philosophy be in this evil case, still there\nremains a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts.\nAnd many are thus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and\nwhose souls are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses, as their\nbodies are by their trades and crafts. Is not this unavoidable?\n\nYes. \nAre they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out\nof durance and come into a fortune; he takes a bath and puts on a\nnew coat, and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master's\ndaughter, who is left poor and desolate? \n\nA most exact parallel. \nWhat will be the issue of such marriages? Will they not be vile and\nbastard? \n\nThere can be no question of it. \nAnd when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy\nand make an alliance with her who is a rank above them what sort of\nideas and opinions are likely to be generated? Will they not be sophisms\ncaptivating to the ear, having nothing in them genuine, or worthy\nof or akin to true wisdom? \n\nNo doubt, he said. \nThen, Adeimantus, I said, the worthy disciples of philosophy will\nbe but a small remnant: perchance some noble and well-educated person,\ndetained by exile in her service, who in the absence of corrupting\ninfluences remains devoted to her; or some lofty soul born in a mean\ncity, the politics of which he contemns and neglects; and there may\nbe a gifted few who leave the arts, which they justly despise, and\ncome to her; --or peradventure there are some who are restrained by\nour friend Theages' bridle; for everything in the life of Theages\nconspired to divert him from philosophy; but ill-health kept him away\nfrom politics. My own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning,\nfor rarely, if ever, has such a monitor been given to any other man.\nThose who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed\na possession philosophy is, and have also seen enough of the madness\nof the multitude; and they know that no politician is honest, nor\nis there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and\nbe saved. Such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among\nwild beasts --he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows, but\nneither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures, and\ntherefore seeing that he would be of no use to the State or to his\nfriends, and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life\nwithout doing any good either to himself or others, he holds his peace,\nand goes his own way. He is like one who, in the storm of dust and\nsleet which the driving wind hurries along, retires under the shelter\nof a wall; and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness, he is\ncontent, if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or\nunrighteousness, and depart in peace and good-will, with bright hopes.\n\nYes, he said, and he will have done a great work before he departs.\n\nA great work --yes; but not the greatest, unless he find a State suitable\nto him; for in a State which is suitable to him, he will have a larger\ngrowth and be the saviour of his country, as well as of himself.\n\nThe causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently\nexplained: the injustice of the charges against her has been shown-is\nthere anything more which you wish to say? \n\nNothing more on that subject, he replied; but I should like to know\nwhich of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted\nto her. \n\nNot any of them, I said; and that is precisely the accusation which\nI bring against them --not one of them is worthy of the philosophic\nnature, and hence that nature is warped and estranged; --as the exotic\nseed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized, and is\nwont to be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil, even so\nthis growth of philosophy, instead of persisting, degenerates and\nreceives another character. But if philosophy ever finds in the State\nthat perfection which she herself is, then will be seen that she is\nin truth divine, and that all other things, whether natures of men\nor institutions, are but human; --and now, I know that you are going\nto ask, what that State is. \n\nNo, he said; there you are wrong, for I was going to ask another question\n--whether it is the State of which. we are the founders and inventors,\nor some other? \n\nYes, I replied, ours in most respects; but you may remember my saying\nbefore, that some living authority would always be required in the\nState having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when\nas legislator you were laying down the laws. \n\nThat was said, he replied. \nYes, but not in a satisfactory manner; you frightened us by interposing\nobjections, which certainly showed that the discussion would be long\nand difficult; and what still remains is the reverse of easy.\n\nWhat is there remaining? \nThe question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not\nto be the ruin of the State: All great attempts are attended with\nrisk; 'hard is the good,' as men say. \n\nStill, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will\nthen be complete. \n\nI shall not be hindered, I said, by any want of will, but, if at all,\nby a want of power: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please\nto remark in what I am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly\nI declare that States should pursue philosophy, not as they do now,\nbut in a different spirit. \n\nIn what manner? \nAt present, I said, the students of philosophy are quite young; beginning\nwhen they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the time saved\nfrom moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even those\nof them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit, when\nthey come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject, I mean\ndialectic, take themselves off. In after life when invited by some\none else, they may, perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about this\nthey make much ado, for philosophy is not considered by them to be\ntheir proper business: at last, when they grow old, in most cases\nthey are extinguished more truly than Heracleitus' sun, inasmuch as\nthey never light up again. \n\nBut what ought to be their course? \nJust the opposite. In childhood and youth their study, and what philosophy\nthey learn, should be suited to their tender years: during this period\nwhile they are growing up towards manhood, the chief and special care\nshould be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in\nthe service of philosophy; as life advances and the intellect begins\nto mature, let them increase the gymnastics of the soul; but when\nthe strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military\nduties, then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour,\nas we intend them to live happily here, and to crown this life with\na similar happiness in another. \n\nHow truly in earnest you are, Socrates! he said; I am sure of that;\nand yet most of your hearers, if I am not mistaken, are likely to\nbe still more earnest in their opposition to you, and will never be\nconvinced; Thrasymachus least of all. \n\nDo not make a quarrel, I said, between Thrasymachus and me, who have\nrecently become friends, although, indeed, we were never enemies;\nfor I shall go on striving to the utmost until I either convert him\nand other men, or do something which may profit them against the day\nwhen they live again, and hold the like discourse in another state\nof existence. \n\nYou are speaking of a time which is not very near. \nRather, I replied, of a time which is as nothing in comparison with\neternity. Nevertheless, I do not wonder that the many refuse to believe;\nfor they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realised;\nthey have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy, consisting\nof words artificially brought together, not like these of ours having\na natural unity. But a human being who in word and work is perfectly\nmoulded, as far as he can be, into the proportion and likeness of\nvirtue --such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image, they\nhave never yet seen, neither one nor many of them --do you think that\nthey ever did? \n\nNo indeed. \nNo, my friend, and they have seldom, if ever, heard free and noble\nsentiments; such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every\nmeans in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge,\nwhile they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy, of which\nthe end is opinion and strife, whether they meet with them in the\ncourts of law or in society. \n\nThey are strangers, he said, to the words of which you speak.\n\nAnd this was what we foresaw, and this was the reason why truth forced\nus to admit, not without fear and hesitation, that neither cities\nnor States nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small\nclass of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially\ncompelled, whether they will or not, to take care of the State, and\nuntil a like necessity be laid on the State to obey them; or until\nkings, or if not kings, the sons of kings or princes, are divinely\ninspired ' d with a true love of true philosophy. That either or both\nof these alternatives are impossible, I see no reason to affirm: if\nthey were so, we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and\nvisionaries. Am I not right? \n\nQuite right. \nIf then, in the countless ages of the past, or at the present hour\nin some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken, the perfected\nphilosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior\npower to have the charge of the State, we are ready to assert to the\ndeath, that this our constitution has been, and is --yea, and will\nbe whenever the Muse of Philosophy is queen. There is no impossibility\nin all this; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.\n\nMy opinion agrees with yours, he said. \nBut do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?\n\nI should imagine not, he replied. \nO my friend, I said, do not attack the multitude: they will change\ntheir minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with\nthe view of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education,\nyou show them your philosophers as they really are and describe as\nyou were just now doing their character and profession, and then mankind\nwill see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed\n--if they view him in this new light, they will surely change their\nnotion of him, and answer in another strain. Who can be at enmity\nwith one who loves them, who that is himself gentle and free from\nenvy will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy? Nay, let\nme answer for you, that in a few this harsh temper may be found but\nnot in the majority of mankind. \n\nI quite agree with you, he said. \nAnd do you not also think, as I do, that the harsh feeling which the\nmany entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders, who\nrush in uninvited, and are always abusing them, and finding fault\nwith them, who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation?\nand nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this.\n\nIt is most unbecoming. \nFor he, Adeimantus, whose mind is fixed upon true being, has surely\nno time to look down upon the affairs of earth, or to be filled with\nmalice and envy, contending against men; his eye is ever directed\ntowards things fixed and immutable, which he sees neither injuring\nnor injured by one another, but all in order moving according to reason;\nthese he imitates, and to these he will, as far as he can, conform\nhimself. Can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential\nconverse? \n\nImpossible. \nAnd the philosopher holding converse with the divine order, becomes\norderly and divine, as far as the nature of man allows; but like every\none else, he will suffer from detraction. \n\nOf course. \nAnd if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning, not only himself,\nbut human nature generally, whether in States or individuals, into\nthat which he beholds elsewhere, will he, think you, be an unskilful\nartificer of justice, temperance, and every civil virtue?\n\nAnything but unskilful. \nAnd if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the\ntruth, will they be angry with philosophy? Will they disbelieve us,\nwhen we tell them that no State can be happy which is not designed\nby artists who imitate the heavenly pattern? \n\nThey will not be angry if they understand, he said. But how will they\ndraw out the plan of which you are speaking? \n\nThey will begin by taking the State and the manners of men, from which,\nas from a tablet, they will rub out the picture, and leave a clean\nsurface. This is no easy task. But whether easy or not, herein will\nlie the difference between them and every other legislator, --they\nwill have nothing to do either with individual or State, and will\ninscribe no laws, until they have either found, or themselves made,\na clean surface. \n\nThey will be very right, he said. \nHaving effected this, they will proceed to trace an outline of the\nconstitution? \n\nNo doubt. \nAnd when they are filling in the work, as I conceive, they will often\nturn their eyes upwards and downwards: I mean that they will first\nlook at absolute justice and beauty and temperance, and again at the\nhuman copy; and will mingle and temper the various elements of life\ninto the image of a man; and thus they will conceive according to\nthat other image, which, when existing among men, Homer calls the\nform and likeness of God. \n\nVery true, he said. \nAnd one feature they will erase, and another they will put in, they\nhave made the ways of men, as far as possible, agreeable to the ways\nof God? \n\nIndeed, he said, in no way could they make a fairer picture.\n\nAnd now, I said, are we beginning to persuade those whom you described\nas rushing at us with might and main, that the painter of constitutions\nis such an one as we are praising; at whom they were so very indignant\nbecause to his hands we committed the State; and are they growing\na little calmer at what they have just heard? \n\nMuch calmer, if there is any sense in them. \nWhy, where can they still find any ground for objection? Will they\ndoubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being?\n\nThey would not be so unreasonable. \nOr that his nature, being such as we have delineated, is akin to the\nhighest good? \n\nNeither can they doubt this. \nBut again, will they tell us that such a nature, placed under favourable\ncircumstances, will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was?\nOr will they prefer those whom we have rejected? \n\nSurely not. \nThen will they still be angry at our saying, that, until philosophers\nbear rule, States and individuals will have no rest from evil, nor\nwill this our imaginary State ever be realised? \n\nI think that they will be less angry. \nShall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle,\nand that they have been converted and for very shame, if for no other\nreason, cannot refuse to come to terms? \n\nBy all means, he said. \nThen let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected. Will\nany one deny the other point, that there may be sons of kings or princes\nwho are by nature philosophers? \n\nSurely no man, he said. \nAnd when they have come into being will any one say that they must\nof necessity be destroyed; that they can hardly be saved is not denied\neven by us; but that in the whole course of ages no single one of\nthem can escape --who will venture to affirm this? \n\nWho indeed! \nBut, said I, one is enough; let there be one man who has a city obedient\nto his will, and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about\nwhich the world is so incredulous. \n\nYes, one is enough. \nThe ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been\ndescribing, and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd that others should approve of what we approve, is no miracle or\nimpossibility? \n\nI think not. \nBut we have sufficiently shown, in what has preceded, that all this,\nif only possible, is assuredly for the best. \n\nWe have. \nAnd now we say not only that our laws, if they could be enacted, would\nbe for the best, but also that the enactment of them, though difficult,\nis not impossible. \n\nVery good. \nAnd so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject,\nbut more remains to be discussed; --how and by what studies and pursuits\nwill the saviours of the constitution be created, and at what ages\nare they to apply themselves to their several studies? \n\nCertainly. \nI omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women, and\nthe procreation of children, and the appointment of the rulers, because\nI knew that the perfect State would be eyed with jealousy and was\ndifficult of attainment; but that piece of cleverness was not of much\nservice to me, for I had to discuss them all the same. The women and\nchildren are now disposed of, but the other question of the rulers\nmust be investigated from the very beginning. We were saying, as you\nwill remember, that they were to be lovers of their country, tried\nby the test of pleasures and pains, and neither in hardships, nor\nin dangers, nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism\n--he was to be rejected who failed, but he who always came forth pure,\nlike gold tried in the refiner's fire, was to be made a ruler, and\nto receive honours and rewards in life and after death. This was the\nsort of thing which was being said, and then the argument turned aside\nand veiled her face; not liking to stir the question which has now\narisen. \n\nI perfectly remember, he said. \nYes, my friend, I said, and I then shrank from hazarding the bold\nword; but now let me dare to say --that the perfect guardian must\nbe a philosopher. \n\nYes, he said, let that be affirmed. \nAnd do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts\nwhich were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they\nare mostly found in shreds and patches. \n\nWhat do you mean? he said. \nYou are aware, I replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity,\ncleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and\nthat persons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited\nand magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly\nand in a peaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their\nimpulses, and all solid principle goes out of them. \n\nVery true, he said. \nOn the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be depended\nupon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are\nequally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are always\nin a torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual\ntoil. \n\nQuite true. \nAnd yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those\nto whom the higher education is to be imparted, and who are to share\nin any office or command. \n\nCertainly, he said. \nAnd will they be a class which is rarely found? \nYes, indeed. \nThen the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers\nand pleasures which we mentioned before, but there is another kind\nof probation which we did not mention --he must be exercised also\nin many kinds of knowledge, to see whether the soul will be able to\nendure the highest of all, will faint under them, as in any other\nstudies and exercises. \n\nYes, he said, you are quite right in testing him. But what do you\nmean by the highest of all knowledge? \n\nYou may remember, I said, that we divided the soul into three parts;\nand distinguished the several natures of justice, temperance, courage,\nand wisdom? \n\nIndeed, he said, if I had forgotten, I should not deserve to hear\nmore. \n\nAnd do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion\nof them? \n\nTo what do you refer? \nWe were saying, if I am not mistaken, that he who wanted to see them\nin their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way,\nat the end of which they would appear; but that we could add on a\npopular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had\npreceded. And you replied that such an exposition would be enough\nfor you, and so the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to\nbe a very inaccurate manner; whether you were satisfied or not, it\nis for you to say. \n\nYes, he said, I thought and the others thought that you gave us a\nfair measure of truth. \n\nBut, my friend, I said, a measure of such things Which in any degree\nfalls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing imperfect\nis the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to be contented\nand think that they need search no further. \n\nNot an uncommon case when people are indolent. \nYes, I said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of\nthe State and of the laws. \n\nTrue. \nThe guardian then, I said, must be required to take the longer circuit,\nand toll at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach\nthe highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is\nhis proper calling. \n\nWhat, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this --higher\nthan justice and the other virtues? \n\nYes, I said, there is. And of the virtues too we must behold not the\noutline merely, as at present --nothing short of the most finished\npicture should satisfy us. When little things are elaborated with\nan infinity of pains, in order that they may appear in their full\nbeauty and utmost clearness, how ridiculous that we should not think\nthe highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy!\n\nA right noble thought; but do you suppose that we shall refrain from\nasking you what is this highest knowledge? \n\nNay, I said, ask if you will; but I am certain that you have heard\nthe answer many times, and now you either do not understand me or,\nas I rather think, you are disposed to be troublesome; for you have\nof been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge, and that\nall other things become useful and advantageous only by their use\nof this. You can hardly be ignorant that of this I was about to speak,\nconcerning which, as you have often heard me say, we know so little;\nand, without which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind\nwill profit us nothing. Do you think that the possession of all other\nthings is of any value if we do not possess the good? or the knowledge\nof all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness?\n\nAssuredly not. \nYou are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good,\nbut the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge \n\nYes. \nAnd you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean\nby knowledge, but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good?\n\nHow ridiculous! \nYes, I said, that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance\nof the good, and then presume our knowledge of it --for the good they\ndefine to be knowledge of the good, just as if we understood them\nwhen they use the term 'good' --this is of course ridiculous.\n\nMost true, he said. \nAnd those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity; for\nthey are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as\ngood. \n\nCertainly. \nAnd therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same?\n\nTrue. \nThere can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this\nquestion is involved. \n\nThere can be none. \nFurther, do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to\nseem to be what is just and honourable without the reality; but no\none is satisfied with the appearance of good --the reality is what\nthey seek; in the case of the good, appearance is despised by every\none. \n\nVery true, he said. \nOf this then, which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of\nall his actions, having a presentiment that there is such an end,\nand yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the\nsame assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever\ngood there is in other things, --of a principle such and so great\nas this ought the best men in our State, to whom everything is entrusted,\nto be in the darkness of ignorance? \n\nCertainly not, he said. \nI am sure, I said, that he who does not know now the beautiful and\nthe just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and\nI suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true\nknowledge of them. \n\nThat, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours. \nAnd if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our State will\nbe perfectly ordered? \n\nOf course, he replied; but I wish that you would tell me whether you\nconceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure,\nor different from either. \n\nAye, I said, I knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you\nwould not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these\nmatters. \n\nTrue, Socrates; but I must say that one who like you has passed a\nlifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating\nthe opinions of others, and never telling his own. \n\nWell, but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know?\n\nNot, he said, with the assurance of positive certainty; he has no\nright to do that: but he may say what he thinks, as a matter of opinion.\n\nAnd do you not know, I said, that all mere opinions are bad, and the\nbest of them blind? You would not deny that those who have any true\nnotion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their\nway along the road? \n\nVery true. \nAnd do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base, when\nothers will tell you of brightness and beauty? \n\nGlaucon - SOCRATES \n\nStill, I must implore you, Socrates, said Glaucon, not to turn away\njust as you are reaching the goal; if you will only give such an explanation\nof the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and\nthe other virtues, we shall be satisfied. \n\nYes, my friend, and I shall be at least equally satisfied, but I cannot\nhelp fearing that I shall fall, and that my indiscreet zeal will bring\nridicule upon me. No, sweet sirs, let us not at present ask what is\nthe actual nature of the good, for to reach what is now in my thoughts\nwould be an effort too great for me. But of the child of the good\nwho is likest him, I would fain speak, if I could be sure that you\nwished to hear --otherwise, not. \n\nBy all means, he said, tell us about the child, and you shall remain\nin our debt for the account of the parent. \n\nI do indeed wish, I replied, that I could pay, and you receive, the\naccount of the parent, and not, as now, of the offspring only; take,\nhowever, this latter by way of interest, and at the same time have\na care that i do not render a false account, although I have no intention\nof deceiving you. \n\nYes, we will take all the care that we can: proceed. \nYes, I said, but I must first come to an understanding with you, and\nremind you of what I have mentioned in the course of this discussion,\nand at many other times. \n\nWhat? \nThe old story, that there is a many beautiful and a many good, and\nso of other things which we describe and define; to all of them 'many'\nis applied. \n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good, and of other\nthings to which the term 'many' is applied there is an absolute; for\nthey may be brought under a single idea, which is called the essence\nof each. \n\nVery true. \nThe many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known\nbut not seen. \n\nExactly. \nAnd what is the organ with which we see the visible things?\n\nThe sight, he said. \nAnd with the hearing, I said, we hear, and with the other senses perceive\nthe other objects of sense? \n\nTrue. \nBut have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex\npiece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived?\n\nNo, I never have, he said. \nThen reflect; has the ear or voice need of any third or additional\nnature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to\nbe heard? \n\nNothing of the sort. \nNo, indeed, I replied; and the same is true of most, if not all, the\nother senses --you would not say that any of them requires such an\naddition? \n\nCertainly not. \nBut you see that without the addition of some other nature there is\nno seeing or being seen? \n\nHow do you mean? \nSight being, as I conceive, in the eyes, and he who has eyes wanting\nto see; colour being also present in them, still unless there be a\nthird nature specially adapted to the purpose, the owner of the eyes\nwill see nothing and the colours will be invisible. \n\nOf what nature are you speaking? \nOf that which you term light, I replied. \nTrue, he said. \nNoble, then, is the bond which links together sight and visibility,\nand great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature; for\nlight is their bond, and light is no ignoble thing? \n\nNay, he said, the reverse of ignoble. \nAnd which, I said, of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord\nof this element? Whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly\nand the visible to appear? \n\nYou mean the sun, as you and all mankind say. \nMay not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows?\n\nHow? \nNeither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun?\n\nNo. \nYet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun?\n\nBy far the most like. \nAnd the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which\nis dispensed from the sun? \n\nExactly. \nThen the sun is not sight, but the author of sight who is recognised\nby sight. \n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd this is he whom I call the child of the good, whom the good begat\nin his own likeness, to be in the visible world, in relation to sight\nand the things of sight, what the good is in the intellectual world\nin relation to mind and the things of mind. \n\nWill you be a little more explicit? he said. \nWhy, you know, I said, that the eyes, when a person directs them towards\nobjects on which the light of day is no longer shining, but the moon\nand stars only, see dimly, and are nearly blind; they seem to have\nno clearness of vision in them? \n\nVery true. \nBut when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines,\nthey see clearly and there is sight in them? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd the soul is like the eye: when resting upon that on which truth\nand being shine, the soul perceives and understands and is radiant\nwith intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming\nand perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about,\nand is first of one opinion and then of another, and seems to have\nno intelligence? \n\nJust so. \nNow, that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing\nto the knower is what I would have you term the idea of good, and\nthis you will deem to be the cause of science, and of truth in so\nfar as the latter becomes the subject of knowledge; beautiful too,\nas are both truth and knowledge, you will be right in esteeming this\nother nature as more beautiful than either; and, as in the previous\ninstance, light and sight may be truly said to be like the sun, and\nyet not to be the sun, so in this other sphere, science and truth\nmay be deemed to be like the good, but not the good; the good has\na place of honour yet higher. \n\nWhat a wonder of beauty that must be, he said, which is the author\nof science and truth, and yet surpasses them in beauty; for you surely\ncannot mean to say that pleasure is the good? \n\nGod forbid, I replied; but may I ask you to consider the image in\nanother point of view? \n\nIn what point of view? \nYou would say, would you not, that the sun is only the author of visibility\nin all visible things, but of generation and nourishment and growth,\nthough he himself is not generation? \n\nCertainly. \nIn like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge\nto all things known, but of their being and essence, and yet the good\nis not essence, but far exceeds essence in dignity and power.\n\nGlaucon said, with a ludicrous earnestness: By the light of heaven,\nhow amazing! \n\nYes, I said, and the exaggeration may be set down to you; for you\nmade me utter my fancies. \n\nAnd pray continue to utter them; at any rate let us hear if there\nis anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun.\n\nYes, I said, there is a great deal more. \nThen omit nothing, however slight. \nI will do my best, I said; but I should think that a great deal will\nhave to be omitted. \n\nYou have to imagine, then, that there are two ruling powers, and that\none of them is set over the intellectual world, the other over the\nvisible. I do not say heaven, lest you should fancy that I am playing\nupon the name ('ourhanoz, orhatoz'). May I suppose that you have this\ndistinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind?\n\nI have. \nNow take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts, and divide\neach of them again in the same proportion, and suppose the two main\ndivisions to answer, one to the visible and the other to the intelligible,\nand then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and\nwant of clearness, and you will find that the first section in the\nsphere of the visible consists of images. And by images I mean, in\nthe first place, shadows, and in the second place, reflections in\nwater and in solid, smooth and polished bodies and the like: Do you\nunderstand? \n\nYes, I understand. \nImagine, now, the other section, of which this is only the resemblance,\nto include the animals which we see, and everything that grows or\nis made. \n\nVery good. \nWould you not admit that both the sections of this division have different\ndegrees of truth, and that the copy is to the original as the sphere\nof opinion is to the sphere of knowledge? \n\nMost undoubtedly. \nNext proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual\nis to be divided. \n\nIn what manner? \nThus: --There are two subdivisions, in the lower or which the soul\nuses the figures given by the former division as images; the enquiry\ncan only be hypothetical, and instead of going upwards to a principle\ndescends to the other end; in the higher of the two, the soul passes\nout of hypotheses, and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses,\nmaking no use of images as in the former case, but proceeding only\nin and through the ideas themselves. \n\nI do not quite understand your meaning, he said. \nThen I will try again; you will understand me better when I have made\nsome preliminary remarks. You are aware that students of geometry,\narithmetic, and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and\nthe figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several\nbranches of science; these are their hypotheses, which they and everybody\nare supposed to know, and therefore they do not deign to give any\naccount of them either to themselves or others; but they begin with\nthem, and go on until they arrive at last, and in a consistent manner,\nat their conclusion? \n\nYes, he said, I know. \nAnd do you not know also that although they make use of the visible\nforms and reason about them, they are thinking not of these, but of\nthe ideals which they resemble; not of the figures which they draw,\nbut of the absolute square and the absolute diameter, and so on --the\nforms which they draw or make, and which have shadows and reflections\nin water of their own, are converted by them into images, but they\nare really seeking to behold the things themselves, which can only\nbe seen with the eye of the mind? \n\nThat is true. \nAnd of this kind I spoke as the intelligible, although in the search\nafter it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses; not ascending to\na first principle, because she is unable to rise above the region\nof hypothesis, but employing the objects of which the shadows below\nare resemblances in their turn as images, they having in relation\nto the shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness, and\ntherefore a higher value. \n\nI understand, he said, that you are speaking of the province of geometry\nand the sister arts. \n\nAnd when I speak of the other division of the intelligible, you will\nunderstand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason\nherself attains by the power of dialectic, using the hypotheses not\nas first principles, but only as hypotheses --that is to say, as steps\nand points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses, in\norder that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the\nwhole; and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this,\nby successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible\nobject, from ideas, through ideas, and in ideas she ends.\n\nI understand you, he replied; not perfectly, for you seem to me to\nbe describing a task which is really tremendous; but, at any rate,\nI understand you to say that knowledge and being, which the science\nof dialectic contemplates, are clearer than the notions of the arts,\nas they are termed, which proceed from hypotheses only: these are\nalso contemplated by the understanding, and not by the senses: yet,\nbecause they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle,\nthose who contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher\nreason upon them, although when a first principle is added to them\nthey are cognizable by the higher reason. And the habit which is concerned\nwith geometry and the cognate sciences I suppose that you would term\nunderstanding and not reason, as being intermediate between opinion\nand reason. \n\nYou have quite conceived my meaning, I said; and now, corresponding\nto these four divisions, let there be four faculties in the soul-reason\nanswering to the highest, understanding to the second, faith (or conviction)\nto the third, and perception of shadows to the last-and let there\nbe a scale of them, and let us suppose that the several faculties\nhave clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth.\n\nI understand, he replied, and give my assent, and accept your arrangement.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VII\n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nAnd now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened\nor unenlightened: --Behold! human beings living in a underground den,\nwhich has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the\nden; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs\nand necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before\nthem, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads.\nAbove and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between\nthe fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see,\nif you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which\nmarionette players have in front of them, over which they show the\npuppets. \n\nI see. \nAnd do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts\nof vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone\nand various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are\ntalking, others silent. \n\nYou have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.\n\nLike ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or\nthe shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite\nwall of the cave? \n\nTrue, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they\nwere never allowed to move their heads? \n\nAnd of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would\nonly see the shadows? \n\nYes, he said. \nAnd if they were able to converse with one another, would they not\nsuppose that they were naming what was actually before them?\n\nVery true. \nAnd suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the\nother side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by\nspoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?\n\nNo question, he replied. \nTo them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows\nof the images. \n\nThat is certain. \nAnd now look again, and see what will naturally follow it' the prisoners\nare released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them\nis liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck\nround and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains;\nthe glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities\nof which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive\nsome one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but\nthat now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned\ntowards more real existence, he has a clearer vision, -what will be\nhis reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing\nto the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them, -will\nhe not be perplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly\nsaw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?\n\nFar truer. \nAnd if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not\nhave a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and\ntake in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will\nconceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being\nshown to him? \n\nTrue, he now \nAnd suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and\nrugged ascent, and held fast until he 's forced into the presence\nof the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When\nhe approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not\nbe able to see anything at all of what are now called realities.\n\nNot all in a moment, he said. \nHe will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world.\nAnd first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men\nand other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then\nhe will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled\nheaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than\nthe sun or the light of the sun by day? \n\nCertainly. \nLast of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of\nhim in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and\nnot in another; and he will contemplate him as he is. \n\nCertainly. \nHe will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season\nand the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world,\nand in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows\nhave been accustomed to behold? \n\nClearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about\nhim. \n\nAnd when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den\nand his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate\nhimself on the change, and pity them? \n\nCertainly, he would. \nAnd if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves\non those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark\nwhich of them went before, and which followed after, and which were\ntogether; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as\nto the future, do you think that he would care for such honours and\nglories, or envy the possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer,\n\nBetter to be the poor servant of a poor master, and to endure anything,\nrather than think as they do and live after their manner?\n\nYes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain\nthese false notions and live in this miserable manner. \n\nImagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the\nsun to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to\nhave his eyes full of darkness? \n\nTo be sure, he said. \nAnd if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the\nshadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den, while\nhis sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and\nthe time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight\nmight be very considerable) would he not be ridiculous? Men would\nsay of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes; and\nthat it was better not even to think of ascending; and if any one\ntried to loose another and lead him up to the light, let them only\ncatch the offender, and they would put him to death. \n\nNo question, he said. \nThis entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to\nthe previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the\nlight of the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if\nyou interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into\nthe intellectual world according to my poor belief, which, at your\ndesire, I have expressed whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But,\nwhether true or false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge\nthe idea of good appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort;\nand, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all\nthings beautiful and right, parent of light and of the lord of light\nin this visible world, and the immediate source of reason and truth\nin the intellectual; and that this is the power upon which he who\nwould act rationally, either in public or private life must have his\neye fixed. \n\nI agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.\n\nMoreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this\nbeatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their\nsouls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to\ndwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may\nbe trusted. \n\nYes, very natural. \nAnd is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations\nto the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner;\nif, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed\nto the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of\nlaw, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of images\nof justice, and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who\nhave never yet seen absolute justice? \n\nAnything but surprising, he replied. \nAny one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments\nof the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from\ncoming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true\nof the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who\nremembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and\nweak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that\nsoul of man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see\nbecause unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to\nthe day is dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy\nin his condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or,\nif he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into\nthe light, there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which\ngreets him who returns from above out of the light into the den.\n\nThat, he said, is a very just distinction. \nBut then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong\nwhen they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was\nnot there before, like sight into blind eyes. \n\nThey undoubtedly say this, he replied. \nWhereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning\nexists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to\nturn from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument\nof knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned\nfrom the world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees\nto endure the sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being,\nor in other words, of the good. \n\nVery true. \nAnd must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the\neasiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight,\nfor that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction,\nand is looking away from the truth? \n\nYes, he said, such an art may be presumed. \nAnd whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin\nto bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate\nthey can be implanted later by habit and exercise, the of wisdom more\nthan anything else contains a divine element which always remains,\nand by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the\nother hand, hurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow\nintelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue --how eager\nhe is, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is\nthe reverse of blind, but his keen eyesight is forced into the service\nof evil, and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness.\n\nVery true, he said. \nBut what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days\nof their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures,\nsuch as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached\nto them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision\nof their souls upon the things that are below --if, I say, they had\nbeen released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction,\nthe very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly\nas they see what their eyes are turned to now. \n\nVery likely. \nYes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely. or rather\na necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated\nand uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of\ntheir education, will be able ministers of State; not the former,\nbecause they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their\nactions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will\nnot act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already\ndwelling apart in the islands of the blest. \n\nVery true, he replied. \nThen, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State\nwill be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we\nhave already shown to be the greatest of all-they must continue to\nascend until they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended\nand seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now.\n\nWhat do you mean? \nI mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed;\nthey must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den,\nand partake of their labours and honours, whether they are worth having\nor not. \n\nBut is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life,\nwhen they might have a better? \n\nYou have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the\nlegislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy\nabove the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he\nheld the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them\nbenefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another;\nto this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his\ninstruments in binding up the State. \n\nTrue, he said, I had forgotten. \nObserve, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our\nphilosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain\nto them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to\nshare in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow\nup at their own sweet will, and the government would rather not have\nthem. Being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude\nfor a culture which they have never received. But we have brought\nyou into the world to be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and\nof the other citizens, and have educated you far better and more perfectly\nthan they have been educated, and you are better able to share in\nthe double duty. Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must\ngo down to the general underground abode, and get the habit of seeing\nin the dark. When you have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand\ntimes better than the inhabitants of the den, and you will know what\nthe several images are, and what they represent, because you have\nseen the beautiful and just and good in their truth. And thus our\nState which is also yours will be a reality, and not a dream only,\nand will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other States,\nin which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted\nin the struggle for power, which in their eyes is a great good. Whereas\nthe truth is that the State in which the rulers are most reluctant\nto govern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the State\nin which they are most eager, the worst. \n\nQuite true, he replied. \nAnd will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn\nat the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater\npart of their time with one another in the heavenly light?\n\nImpossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which\nwe impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one\nof them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion\nof our present rulers of State. \n\nYes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive\nfor your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler,\nand then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State\nwhich offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver\nand gold, but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of\nlife. Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs,\npoor and hungering after the' own private advantage, thinking that\nhence they are to snatch the chief good, order there can never be;\nfor they will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic\nbroils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves\nand of the whole State. \n\nMost true, he replied. \nAnd the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition\nis that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other? \n\nIndeed, I do not, he said. \nAnd those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they\nare, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight. \n\nNo question. \nWho then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they\nwill be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom\nthe State is best administered, and who at the same time have other\nhonours and another and a better life than that of politics?\n\nThey are the men, and I will choose them, he replied. \nAnd now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced,\nand how they are to be brought from darkness to light, --as some are\nsaid to have ascended from the world below to the gods? \n\nBy all means, he replied. \nThe process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but\nthe turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better\nthan night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below,\nwhich we affirm to be true philosophy? \n\nQuite so. \nAnd should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of\neffecting such a change? \n\nCertainly. \nWhat sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming\nto being? And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will\nremember that our young men are to be warrior athletes \n\nYes, that was said. \nThen this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality?\n\nWhat quality? \nUsefulness in war. \nYes, if possible. \nThere were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there\nnot? \n\nJust so. \nThere was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the\nbody, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation\nand corruption? \n\nTrue. \nThen that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover? No.\n\nBut what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent\ninto our former scheme? \n\nMusic, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,\nand trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making\nthem harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science;\nand the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements\nof rhythm and harmony in them. But in music there was nothing which\ntended to that good which you are now seeking. \n\nYou are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music there\ncertainly was nothing of the kind. But what branch of knowledge is\nthere, my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all\nthe useful arts were reckoned mean by us? \n\nUndoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the\narts are also excluded, what remains? \n\nWell, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and\nthen we shall have to take something which is not special, but of\nuniversal application. \n\nWhat may that be? \nA something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common,\nand which every one first has to learn among the elements of education.\n\nWhat is that? \nThe little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three --in a word,\nnumber and calculation: --do not all arts and sciences necessarily\npartake of them? \n\nYes. \nThen the art of war partakes of them? \nTo the sure. \nThen Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon ridiculously\nunfit to be a general. Did you never remark how he declares that he\nhad invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array the\nranks of the army at Troy; which implies that they had never been\nnumbered before, and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have\nbeen incapable of counting his own feet --how could he if he was ignorant\nof number? And if that is true, what sort of general must he have\nbeen? \n\nI should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.\n\nCan we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?\n\nCertainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of\nmilitary tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a\nman at all. \n\nI should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have\nof this study? \n\nWhat is your notion? \nIt appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and\nwhich leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly\nused; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.\n\nWill you explain your meaning? he said. \nI will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with me,\nand say 'yes' or 'no' when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind\nwhat branches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that\nwe may have clearer proof that arithmetic is, as I suspect, one of\nthem. \n\nExplain, he said. \nI mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them\ndo not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them;\nwhile in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that\nfurther enquiry is imperatively demanded. \n\nYou are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses\nare imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.\n\nNo, I said, that is not at all my meaning. \nThen what is your meaning? \nWhen speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not pass\nfrom one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which\ndo; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether\nat a distance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular\nthan of its opposite. An illustration will make my meaning clearer:\n--here are three fingers --a little finger, a second finger, and a\nmiddle finger. \n\nVery good. \nYou may suppose that they are seen quite close: And here comes the\npoint. \n\nWhat is it? \nEach of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle\nor at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin --it\nmakes no difference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases\na man is not compelled to ask of thought the question, what is a finger?\nfor the sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than\na finger. \n\nTrue. \nAnd therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which\ninvites or excites intelligence. \n\nThere is not, he said. \nBut is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers?\nCan sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the\ncircumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another\nat the extremity? And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive\nthe qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness? And\nso of the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters?\nIs not their mode of operation on this wise --the sense which is concerned\nwith the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the\nquality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same\nthing is felt to be both hard and soft? \n\nYou are quite right, he said. \nAnd must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense\ngives of a hard which is also soft? What, again, is the meaning of\nlight and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which\nis heavy, light? \n\nYes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very curious\nand require to be explained. \n\nYes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons\nto her aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether\nthe several objects announced to her are one or two. \n\nTrue. \nAnd if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as\nin a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only\nbe conceived of as one? \n\nTrue. \nThe eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a confused\nmanner; they were not distinguished. \n\nYes. \nWhereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was compelled\nto reverse the process, and look at small and great as separate and\nnot confused. \n\nVery true. \nWas not this the beginning of the enquiry 'What is great?' and 'What\nis small?' \n\nExactly so. \nAnd thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.\n\nMost true. \nThis was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the\nintellect, or the reverse --those which are simultaneous with opposite\nimpressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.\n\nI understand, he said, and agree with you. \nAnd to which class do unity and number belong? \nI do not know, he replied. \nThink a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply\nthe answer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the\nsight or by any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of\nthe finger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when\nthere is some contradiction always present, and one is the reverse\nof one and involves the conception of plurality, then thought begins\nto be aroused within us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive\nat a decision asks 'What is absolute unity?' This is the way in which\nthe study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind\nto the contemplation of true being. \n\nAnd surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we\nsee the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?\n\nYes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all\nnumber? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?\n\nYes. \nAnd they appear to lead the mind towards truth? \nYes, in a very remarkable manner. \nThen this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having\na double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must\nlearn the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops,\nand the philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of\nchange and lay hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.\n\nThat is true. \nAnd our guardian is both warrior and philosopher? \nCertainly. \nThen this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe;\nand we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the\nprincipal men of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs,\nbut they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers\nwith the mind only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with\na view to buying or selling, but for the sake of their military use,\nand of the soul herself; and because this will be the easiest way\nfor her to pass from becoming to truth and being. \n\nThat is excellent, he said. \nYes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming\nthe science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end,\nif pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!\n\nHow do you mean? \nI mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating\neffect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and rebelling\nagainst the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument.\nYou know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any\none who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating,\nand if you divide, they multiply, taking care that one shall continue\none and not become lost in fractions. \n\nThat is very true. \nNow, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are\nthese wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as\nyou say, there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal,\ninvariable, indivisible, --what would they answer? \n\nThey would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of\nthose numbers which can only be realised in thought. \n\nThen you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary, necessitating\nas it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment\nof pure truth? \n\nYes; that is a marked characteristic of it. \nAnd have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent\nfor calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge;\nand even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training, although\nthey may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker\nthan they would otherwise have been. \n\nVery true, he said. \nAnd indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not\nmany as difficult. \n\nYou will not. \nAnd, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which\nthe best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.\n\nI agree. \nLet this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next,\nshall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?\n\nYou mean geometry? \nExactly so. \nClearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which\nrelates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or\nclosing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military manoeuvre,\nwhether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the difference\nwhether a general is or is not a geometrician. \n\nYes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry\nor calculation will be enough; the question relates rather to the\ngreater and more advanced part of geometry --whether that tends in\nany degree to make more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither,\nas I was saying, all things tend which compel the soul to turn her\ngaze towards that place, where is the full perfection of being, which\nshe ought, by all means, to behold. \n\nTrue, he said. \nThen if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming\nonly, it does not concern us? \n\nYes, that is what we assert. \nYet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not\ndeny that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction\nto the ordinary language of geometricians. \n\nHow so? \nThey have in view practice only, and are always speaking? in a narrow\nand ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and\nthe like --they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of\ndaily life; whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.\n\nCertainly, he said. \nThen must not a further admission be made? \nWhat admission? \nThat the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal,\nand not of aught perishing and transient. \n\nThat, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true. \nThen, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth,\nand create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now\nunhappily allowed to fall down. \n\nNothing will be more likely to have such an effect. \nThen nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants\nof your fair city should by all means learn geometry. Moreover the\nscience has indirect effects, which are not small. \n\nOf what kind? he said. \nThere are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and\nin all departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who\nhas studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one\nwho has not. \n\nYes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them.\n\nThen shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our\nyouth will study? \n\nLet us do so, he replied. \nAnd suppose we make astronomy the third --what do you say?\n\nI am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons\nand of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to\nthe farmer or sailor. \n\nI am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you guard\nagainst the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite\nadmit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye\nof the soul which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these\npurified and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand\nbodily eyes, for by it alone is truth seen. Now there are two classes\nof persons: one class of those who will agree with you and will take\nyour words as a revelation; another class to whom they will be utterly\nunmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for\nthey see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them. And\ntherefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you\nare proposing to argue. You will very likely say with neither, and\nthat your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement;\nat the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they\nmay receive. \n\nI think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my\nown behalf. \n\nThen take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of\nthe sciences. \n\nWhat was the mistake? he said. \nAfter plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to solids in revolution,\ninstead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the second dimension\nthe third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth,\nought to have followed. \n\nThat is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about\nthese subjects. \n\nWhy, yes, I said, and for two reasons: --in the first place, no government\npatronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of\nthem, and they are difficult; in the second place, students cannot\nlearn them unless they have a director. But then a director can hardly\nbe found, and even if he could, as matters now stand, the students,\nwho are very conceited, would not attend to him. That, however, would\nbe otherwise if the whole State became the director of these studies\nand gave honour to them; then disciples would want to come, and there\nwould be continuous and earnest search, and discoveries would be made;\nsince even now, disregarded as they are by the world, and maimed of\ntheir fair proportions, and although none of their votaries can tell\nthe use of them, still these studies force their way by their natural\ncharm, and very likely, if they had the help of the State, they would\nsome day emerge into light. \n\nYes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. But I do not clearly\nunderstand the change in the order. First you began with a geometry\nof plane surfaces? \n\nYes, I said. \nAnd you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?\n\nYes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid\ngeometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass\nover this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.\n\nTrue, he said. \nThen assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence\nif encouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will\nbe fourth. \n\nThe right order, he replied. And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the\nvulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before, my praise shall\nbe given in your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that\nastronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this\nworld to another. \n\nEvery one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear,\nbut not to me. \n\nAnd what then would you say? \nI should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy\nappear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards. \n\nWhat do you mean? he asked. \nYou, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our\nknowledge of the things above. And I dare say that if a person were\nto throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still\nthink that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. And you\nare very likely right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion,\nthat knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the\nsoul look upwards, and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks\non the ground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, I would\ndeny that he can learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of science;\nhis soul is looking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge\nis by water or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.\n\nI acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I should\nlike to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more\nconducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking? \n\nI will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought\nupon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most\nperfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far\nto the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which\nare relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained\nin them, in the true number and in every true figure. Now, these are\nto be apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.\n\nTrue, he replied. \nThe spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to\nthat higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures\nor pictures excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other\ngreat artist, which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who\nsaw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship,\nbut he would never dream of thinking that in them he could find the\ntrue equal or the true double, or the truth of any other proportion.\n\nNo, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous. \nAnd will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks\nat the movements of the stars? Will he not think that heaven and the\nthings in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect\nmanner? But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and\nday, or of both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the\nstars to these and to one another, and any other things that are material\nand visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation --that\nwould be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in\ninvestigating their exact truth. \n\nI quite agree, though I never thought of this before. \nThen, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems,\nand let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the\nright way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real\nuse. \n\nThat, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.\n\nYes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have\na similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of\nany value. But can you tell me of any other suitable study?\n\nNo, he said, not without thinking. \nMotion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are\nobvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others,\nas I imagine, which may be left to wiser persons. \n\nBut where are the two? \nThere is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already\nnamed. \n\nAnd what may that be? \nThe second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the\nfirst is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed\nto look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions;\nand these are sister sciences --as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon,\nagree with them? \n\nYes, he replied. \nBut this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better\ngo and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any\nother applications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not\nlose sight of our own higher object. \n\nWhat is that? \nThere is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which\nour pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was\nsaying that they did in astronomy. For in the science of harmony,\nas you probably know, the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony\ncompare the sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their\nlabour, like that of the astronomers, is in vain. \n\nYes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them talking\nabout their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears\nclose alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from\ntheir neighbour's wall --one set of them declaring that they distinguish\nan intermediate note and have found the least interval which should\nbe the unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds\nhave passed into the same --either party setting their ears before\ntheir understanding. \n\nYou mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings\nand rack them on the pegs of the instrument: might carry on the metaphor\nand speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives,\nand make accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and\nforwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will\nonly say that these are not the men, and that I am referring to the\nPythagoreans, of whom I was just now proposing to enquire about harmony.\nFor they too are in error, like the astronomers; they investigate\nthe numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they never attain\nto problems-that is to say, they never reach the natural harmonies\nof number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not.\n\nThat, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.\n\nA thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if\nsought after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued\nin any other spirit, useless. Very true, he said. \n\nNow, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and\nconnection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual\naffinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of\nthem have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in\nthem. \n\nI suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast work.\n\nWhat do you mean? I said; the prelude or what? Do you not know that\nall this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to\nlearn? For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as\na dialectician? \n\nAssuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who\nwas capable of reasoning. \n\nBut do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason\nwill have the knowledge which we require of them? \n\nNeither can this be supposed. \nAnd so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic.\nThis is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which the\nfaculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight,\nas you may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold the\nreal animals and stars, and last of all the sun himself. And so with\ndialectic; when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by\nthe light of reason only, and without any assistance of sense, and\nperseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception\nof the absolute good, he at last finds himself at the end of the intellectual\nworld, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.\n\nExactly, he said. \nThen this is the progress which you call dialectic? \nTrue. \nBut the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation\nfrom the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from\nthe underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly\ntrying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but\nare able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water\n(which are divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows\nof images cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is\nonly an image) --this power of elevating the highest principle in\nthe soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence,\nwith which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the\nvery light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in\nthe material and visible world --this power is given, as I was saying,\nby all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been described.\n\nI agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to believe,\nyet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny. This, however,\nis not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but will have to\nbe discussed again and again. And so, whether our conclusion be true\nor false, let us assume all this, and proceed at once from the prelude\nor preamble to the chief strain, and describe that in like manner.\nSay, then, what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic,\nand what are the paths which lead thither; for these paths will also\nlead to our final rest? \n\nDear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, though\nI would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the\nabsolute truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would\nor would not have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you\nwould have seen something like reality; of that I am confident.\n\nDoubtless, he replied. \nBut I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can\nreveal this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.\n\nOf that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.\n\nAnd assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of\ncomprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining\nwhat each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in general are\nconcerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are cultivated with\na view to production and construction, or for the preservation of\nsuch productions and constructions; and as to the mathematical sciences\nwhich, as we were saying, have some apprehension of true being --geometry\nand the like --they only dream about being, but never can they behold\nthe waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they\nuse unexamined, and are unable to give an account of them. For when\na man knows not his own first principle, and when the conclusion and\nintermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what,\nhow can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become\nscience? \n\nImpossible, he said. \nThen dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first principle\nand is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to\nmake her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is literally buried\nin an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards; and\nshe uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the sciences\nwhich we have been discussing. Custom terms them sciences, but they\nought to have some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion\nand less clearness than science: and this, in our previous sketch,\nwas called understanding. But why should we dispute about names when\nwe have realities of such importance to consider? \n\nWhy indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought\nof the mind with clearness? \n\nAt any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions;\ntwo for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division\nscience, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth\nperception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and\nintellect with being; and so to make a proportion: -- \n\nAs being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion.\n\nAnd as intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding\nto the perception of shadows. But let us defer the further correlation\nand subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect, for it\nwill be a long enquiry, many times longer than this has been.\n\nAs far as I understand, he said, I agree. \nAnd do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one\nwho attains a conception of the essence of each thing? And he who\ndoes not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception,\nin whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail\nin intelligence? Will you admit so much? \n\nYes, he said; how can I deny it? \nAnd you would say the same of the conception of the good?\n\nUntil the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea\nof good, and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and\nis ready to disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute\ntruth, never faltering at any step of the argument --unless he can\ndo all this, you would say that he knows neither the idea of good\nnor any other good; he apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all,\nwhich is given by opinion and not by science; --dreaming and slumbering\nin this life, before he is well awake here, he arrives at the world\nbelow, and has his final quietus. \n\nIn all that I should most certainly agree with you. \nAnd surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom\nyou are nurturing and educating --if the ideal ever becomes a reality\n--you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts, having no\nreason in them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?\n\nCertainly not. \nThen you will make a law that they shall have such an education as\nwill enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering\nquestions? \n\nYes, he said, you and I together will make it. \nDialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences,\nand is set over them; no other science can be placed higher --the\nnature of knowledge can no further go? \n\nI agree, he said. \nBut to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are\nto be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered?\n\nYes, clearly. \nYou remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?\n\nCertainly, he said. \nThe same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given\nto the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and,\nhaving noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural\ngifts which will facilitate their education. \n\nAnd what are these? \nSuch gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind\nmore often faints from the severity of study than from the severity\nof gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not\nshared with the body. \n\nVery true, he replied. \nFurther, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and\nbe an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or\nhe will never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise\nand to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which\nwe require of him. \n\nCertainly, he said; he must have natural gifts. \nThe mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no\nvocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she\nhas fallen into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand\nand not bastards. \n\nWhat do you mean? \nIn the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting industry\n--I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle: as,\nfor example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all\nother bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour\nof learning or listening or enquiring. Or the occupation to which\nhe devotes himself may be of an opposite kind, and he may have the\nother sort of lameness. \n\nCertainly, he said. \nAnd as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and\nlame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at\nherself and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary\nfalsehood, and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the\nmire of ignorance, and has no shame at being detected? \n\nTo be sure. \nAnd, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every\nother virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true\nson and the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities\nStates and individuals unconsciously err and the State makes a ruler,\nand the individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part\nof virtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard. \n\nThat is very true, he said. \nAll these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us;\nand if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education\nand training are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have\nnothing to say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution\nand of the State; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the\nreverse will happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule\non philosophy than she has to endure at present. \n\nThat would not be creditable. \nCertainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into\nearnest I am equally ridiculous. \n\nIn what respect? \nI had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with\ntoo much excitement. For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled\nunder foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at\nthe authors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.\n\nIndeed! I was listening, and did not think so. \nBut I, who am the speaker, felt that I was. And now let me remind\nyou that, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must\nnot do so in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a\nman when he grows old may learn many things --for he can no more learn\nmuch than he can run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary\ntoil. \n\nOf course. \nAnd, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements\nof instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented\nto the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing\nour system of education. \n\nWhy not? \nBecause a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge\nof any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the\nbody; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no\nhold on the mind. \n\nVery true. \nThen, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but let early\neducation be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to\nfind out the natural bent. \n\nThat is a very rational notion, he said. \nDo you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the\nbattle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to\nbe brought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood\ngiven them? \n\nYes, I remember. \nThe same practice may be followed, I said, in all these things --labours,\nlessons, dangers --and he who is most at home in all of them ought\nto be enrolled in a select number. \n\nAt what age? \nAt the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether\nof two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless\nfor any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to\nlearning; and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is\none of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected.\n\nCertainly, he replied. \nAfter that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years\nold will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they\nlearned without any order in their early education will now be brought\ntogether, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of\nthem to one another and to true being. \n\nYes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting\nroot. \n\nYes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion\nof dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical.\n\nI agree with you, he said. \nThese, I said, are the points which you must consider; and those who\nhave most of this comprehension, and who are more steadfast in their\nlearning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they\nhave arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of\nthe select class, and elevated to higher honour; and you will have\nto prove them by the help of dialectic, in order to learn which of\nthem is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses, and\nin company with truth to attain absolute being: And here, my friend,\ngreat caution is required. \n\nWhy great caution? \nDo you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has\nintroduced? \n\nWhat evil? he said. \nThe students of the art are filled with lawlessness. \nQuite true, he said. \nDo you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable\nin their case? or will you make allowance for them? \n\nIn what way make allowance? \nI want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious\nson who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous\nfamily, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he learns\nthat his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he\nis unable to discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave\ntowards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during\nthe period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again\nwhen he knows? Or shall I guess for you? \n\nIf you please. \nThen I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will\nbe likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations\nmore than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them\nwhen in need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be\nless willing to disobey them in any important matter. \n\nHe will. \nBut when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would\ndiminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted\nto the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase;\nhe would now live after their ways, and openly associate with them,\nand, unless he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble\nhimself no more about his supposed parents or other relations.\n\nWell, all that is very probable. But how is the image applicable to\nthe disciples of philosophy? \n\nIn this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice\nand honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental\nauthority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.\n\nThat is true. \nThere are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter\nand attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any\nsense of right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of\ntheir fathers. \n\nTrue. \nNow, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks\nwhat is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught\nhim, and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he\nis driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than\ndishonourable, or just and good any more than the reverse, and so\nof all the notions which he most valued, do you think that he will\nstill honour and obey them as before? \n\nImpossible. \nAnd when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore,\nand he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any\nlife other than that which flatters his desires? \n\nHe cannot. \nAnd from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker\nof it? \n\nUnquestionably. \nNow all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have\ndescribed, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.\n\nYes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable. \nTherefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens\nwho are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in introducing\nthem to dialectic. \n\nCertainly. \nThere is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early;\nfor youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the\ntaste in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting\nand refuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs,\nthey rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.\n\nYes, he said, there is nothing which they like better. \nAnd when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the\nhands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing\nanything which they believed before, and hence, not only they, but\nphilosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with\nthe rest of the world. \n\nToo true, he said. \nBut when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of\nsuch insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for\ntruth, and not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement;\nand the greater moderation of his character will increase instead\nof diminishing the honour of the pursuit. \n\nVery true, he said. \nAnd did we not make special provision for this, when we said that\nthe disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not,\nas now, any chance aspirant or intruder? \n\nVery true. \nSuppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics\nand to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice\nthe number of years which were passed in bodily exercise --will that\nbe enough? \n\nWould you say six or four years? he asked. \nSay five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be sent\ndown again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other\noffice which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will\nget their experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of\ntrying whether, when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation,\nthey will stand firm or flinch. \n\nAnd how long is this stage of their lives to last? \nFifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years\nof age, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves\nin every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come\nat last to their consummation; the time has now arrived at which they\nmust raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens\nall things, and behold the absolute good; for that is the, pattern\naccording to which they are to order the State and the lives of individuals,\nand the remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their\nchief pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics\nand ruling for the public good, not as though they were performing\nsome heroic action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they\nhave brought up in each generation others like themselves and left\nthem in their place to be governors of the State, then they will depart\nto the Islands of the Blest and dwell there; and the city will give\nthem public memorials and sacrifices and honour them, if the Pythian\noracle consent, as demi-gods, but if not, as in any case blessed and\ndivine. \n\nYou are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our governors\nfaultless in beauty. \n\nYes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not\nsuppose that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to\nwomen as far as their natures can go. \n\nThere you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in\nall things like the men. \n\nWell, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has been\nsaid about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and although\ndifficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been\nsupposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born\nin a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this present\nworld which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things\nright and the honour that springs from right, and regarding justice\nas the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose ministers\nthey are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set\nin order their own city? \n\nHow will they proceed? \nThey will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants\nof the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession\nof their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents;\nthese they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the\nlaws which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution\nof which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness,\nand the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.\n\nYes, that will be the best way. And I think, Socrates, that you have\nvery well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into\nbeing. \n\nEnough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its image\n--there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.\n\nThere is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in thinking\nthat nothing more need be said. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK VIII\n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nAnd so, Glaucon, we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect\nState wives and children are to be in common; and that all education\nand the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common, and the best\nphilosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings?\n\nThat, replied Glaucon, has been acknowledged. \nYes, I said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors,\nwhen appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them\nin houses such as we were describing, which are common to all, and\ncontain nothing private, or individual; and about their property,\nyou remember what we agreed? \n\nYes, I remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions\nof mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving\nfrom the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their maintenance,\nand they were to take care of themselves and of the whole State.\n\nTrue, I said; and now that this division of our task is concluded,\nlet us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into\nthe old path. \n\nThere is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that\nyou had finished the description of the State: you said that such\na State was good, and that the man was good who answered to it, although,\nas now appears, you had more excellent things to relate both of State\nand man. And you said further, that if this was the true form, then\nthe others were false; and of the false forms, you said, as I remember,\nthat there were four principal ones, and that their defects, and the\ndefects of the individuals corresponding to them, were worth examining.\nWhen we had seen all the individuals, and finally agreed as to who\nwas the best and who was the worst of them, we were to consider whether\nthe best was not also the happiest, and the worst the most miserable.\nI asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke,\nand then Polemarchus and Adeimantus put in their word; and you began\nagain, and have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived.\n\nYour recollection, I said, is most exact. \nThen, like a wrestler, he replied, you must put yourself again in\nthe same position; and let me ask the same questions, and do you give\nme the same answer which you were about to give me then.\n\nYes, if I can, I will, I said. \nI shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions\nof which you were speaking. \n\nThat question, I said, is easily answered: the four governments of\nwhich I spoke, so far as they have distinct names, are, first, those\nof Crete and Sparta, which are generally applauded; what is termed\noligarchy comes next; this is not equally approved, and is a form\nof government which teems with evils: thirdly, democracy, which naturally\nfollows oligarchy, although very different: and lastly comes tyranny,\ngreat and famous, which differs from them all, and is the fourth and\nworst disorder of a State. I do not know, do you? of any other constitution\nwhich can be said to have a distinct character. There are lordships\nand principalities which are bought and sold, and some other intermediate\nforms of government. But these are nondescripts and may be found equally\namong Hellenes and among barbarians. \n\nYes, he replied, we certainly hear of many curious forms of government\nwhich exist among them. \n\nDo you know, I said, that governments vary as the dispositions of\nmen vary, and that there must be as many of the one as there are of\nthe other? For we cannot suppose that States are made of 'oak and\nrock,' and not out of the human natures which are in them, and which\nin a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them?\n\nYes, he said, the States are as the men are; they grow out of human\ncharacters. \n\nThen if the constitutions of States are five, the dispositions of\nindividual minds will also be five? \n\nCertainly. \nHim who answers to aristocracy, and whom we rightly call just and\ngood, we have already described. \n\nWe have. \nThen let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures,\nbeing the contentious and ambitious, who answer to the Spartan polity;\nalso the oligarchical, democratical, and tyrannical. Let us place\nthe most just by the side of the most unjust, and when we see them\nwe shall be able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness\nof him who leads a life of pure justice or pure injustice. The enquiry\nwill then be completed. And we shall know whether we ought to pursue\ninjustice, as Thrasymachus advises, or in accordance with the conclusions\nof the argument to prefer justice. \n\nCertainly, he replied, we must do as you say. \nShall we follow our old plan, which we adopted with a view to clearness,\nof taking the State first and then proceeding to the individual, and\nbegin with the government of honour? --I know of no name for such\na government other than timocracy, or perhaps timarchy. We will compare\nwith this the like character in the individual; and, after that, consider\noligarchical man; and then again we will turn our attention to democracy\nand the democratical man; and lastly, we will go and view the city\nof tyranny, and once more take a look into the tyrant's soul, and\ntry to arrive at a satisfactory decision. \n\nThat way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable.\n\nFirst, then, I said, let us enquire how timocracy (the government\nof honour) arises out of aristocracy (the government of the best).\nClearly, all political changes originate in divisions of the actual\ngoverning power; a government which is united, however small, cannot\nbe moved. \n\nVery true, he said. \nIn what way, then, will our city be moved, and in what manner the\ntwo classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or\nwith one another? Shall we, after the manner of Homer, pray the Muses\nto tell us 'how discord first arose'? Shall we imagine them in solemn\nmockery, to play and jest with us as if we were children, and to address\nus in a lofty tragic vein, making believe to be in earnest?\n\nHow would they address us? \nAfter this manner: --A city which is thus constituted can hardly be\nshaken; but, seeing that everything which has a beginning has also\nan end, even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever,\nbut will in time be dissolved. And this is the dissolution: --In plants\nthat grow in the earth, as well as in animals that move on the earth's\nsurface, fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences\nof the circles of each are completed, which in short-lived existences\npass over a short space, and in long-lived ones over a long space.\nBut to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom\nand education of your rulers will not attain; the laws which regulate\nthem will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with\nsense, but will escape them, and they will bring children into the\nworld when they ought not. Now that which is of divine birth has a\nperiod which is contained in a perfect number, but the period of human\nbirth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by involution\nand evolution (or squared and cubed) obtaining three intervals and\nfour terms of like and unlike, waxing and waning numbers, make all\nthe terms commensurable and agreeable to one another. The base of\nthese (3) with a third added (4) when combined with five (20) and\nraised to the third power furnishes two harmonies; the first a square\nwhich is a hundred times as great (400 = 4 X 100), and the other a\nfigure having one side equal to the former, but oblong, consisting\nof a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square (i.\ne. omitting fractions), the side of which is five (7 X 7 = 49 X 100\n= 4900), each of them being less by one (than the perfect square which\nincludes the fractions, sc. 50) or less by two perfect squares of\nirrational diameters (of a square the side of which is five = 50 +\n50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of three (27 X 100 = 2700 + 4900 +\n400 = 8000). Now this number represents a geometrical figure which\nhas control over the good and evil of births. For when your guardians\nare ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and bridegroom\nout of season, the children will not be goodly or fortunate. And though\nonly the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors, still\nthey will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places, and when they\ncome into power as guardians, they will soon be found to fall in taking\ncare of us, the Muses, first by under-valuing music; which neglect\nwill soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of your State\nwill be less cultivated. In the succeeding generation rulers will\nbe appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal\nof your different races, which, like Hesiod's, are of gold and silver\nand brass and iron. And so iron will be mingled with silver, and brass\nwith gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality\nand irregularity, which always and in all places are causes of hatred\nand war. This the Muses affirm to be the stock from which discord\nhas sprung, wherever arising; and this is their answer to us.\n\nYes, and we may assume that they answer truly. \nWhy, yes, I said, of course they answer truly; how can the Muses speak\nfalsely? \n\nAnd what do the Muses say next? \nWhen discord arose, then the two races were drawn different ways:\nthe iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and\ngold and silver; but the gold and silver races, not wanting money\nbut having the true riches in their own nature, inclined towards virtue\nand the ancient order of things. There was a battle between them,\nand at last they agreed to distribute their land and houses among\nindividual owners; and they enslaved their friends and maintainers,\nwhom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen, and\nmade of them subjects and servants; and they themselves were engaged\nin war and in keeping a watch against them. \n\nI believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change.\n\nAnd the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate\nbetween oligarchy and aristocracy? \n\nVery true. \nSuch will be the change, and after the change has been made, how will\nthey proceed? Clearly, the new State, being in a mean between oligarchy\nand the perfect State, will partly follow one and partly the other,\nand will also have some peculiarities. \n\nTrue, he said. \nIn the honour given to rulers, in the abstinence of the warrior class\nfrom agriculture, handicrafts, and trade in general, in the institution\nof common meals, and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military\ntraining --in all these respects this State will resemble the former.\n\nTrue. \nBut in the fear of admitting philosophers to power, because they are\nno longer to be had simple and earnest, but are made up of mixed elements;\nand in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters,\nwho are by nature fitted for war rather than peace; and in the value\nset by them upon military stratagems and contrivances, and in the\nwaging of everlasting wars --this State will be for the most part\npeculiar. \n\nYes. \nYes, I said; and men of this stamp will be covetous of money, like\nthose who live in oligarchies; they will have, a fierce secret longing\nafter gold and silver, which they will hoard in dark places, having\nmagazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment\nof them; also castles which are just nests for their eggs, and in\nwhich they will spend large sums on their wives, or on any others\nwhom they please. \n\nThat is most true, he said. \nAnd they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring\nthe money which they prize; they will spend that which is another\nman's on the gratification of their desires, stealing their pleasures\nand running away like children from the law, their father: they have\nbeen schooled not by gentle influences but by force, for they have\nneglected her who is the true Muse, the companion of reason and philosophy,\nand have honoured gymnastic more than music. \n\nUndoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is\na mixture of good and evil. \n\nWhy, there is a mixture, I said; but one thing, and one thing only,\nis predominantly seen, --the spirit of contention and ambition; and\nthese are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.\n\nAssuredly, he said. \nSuch is the origin and such the character of this State, which has\nbeen described in outline only; the more perfect execution was not\nrequired, for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly\njust and most perfectly unjust; and to go through all the States and\nall the characters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable\nlabour. \n\nVery true, he replied. \nNow what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into\nbeing, and what is he like? \n\nSocrates - ADEIMANTUS \n\nI think, said Adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which characterises\nhim, he is not unlike our friend Glaucon. \n\nPerhaps, I said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are\nother respects in which he is very different. \n\nIn what respects? \nHe should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and\nyet a friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no\nspeaker. Such a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the\neducated man, who is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous\nto freemen, and remarkably obedient to authority; he is a lover of\npower and a lover of honour; claiming to be a ruler, not because he\nis eloquent, or on any ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier\nand has performed feats of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises\nand of the chase. \n\nYes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.\n\nSuch an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets\nolder he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a\npiece of the avaricious nature in him, and is not singleminded towards\nvirtue, having lost his best guardian. \n\nWho was that? said Adeimantus. \nPhilosophy, I said, tempered with music, who comes and takes her abode\nin a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.\n\nGood, he said. \nSuch, I said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the timocratical\nState. \n\nExactly. \nHis origin is as follows: --He is often the young son of a grave father,\nwho dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours\nand offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way,\nbut is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble.\n\nAnd how does the son come into being? \nThe character of the son begins to develop when he hears his mother\ncomplaining that her husband has no place in the government, of which\nthe consequence is that she has no precedence among other women. Further,\nwhen she sees her husband not very eager about money, and instead\nof battling and railing in the law courts or assembly, taking whatever\nhappens to him quietly; and when she observes that his thoughts always\ncentre in himself, while he treats her with very considerable indifference,\nshe is annoyed, and says to her son that his father is only half a\nman and far too easy-going: adding all the other complaints about\nher own ill-treatment which women are so fond of rehearsing.\n\nYes, said Adeimantus, they give us plenty of them, and their complaints\nare so like themselves. \n\nAnd you know, I said, that the old servants also, who are supposed\nto be attached to the family, from time to time talk privately in\nthe same strain to the son; and if they see any one who owes money\nto his father, or is wronging him in any way, and he falls to prosecute\nthem, they tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate\nupon people of this sort, and be more of a man than his father. He\nhas only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing:\nthose who do their own business in the city are called simpletons,\nand held in no esteem, while the busy-bodies are honoured and applauded.\nThe result is that the young man, hearing and seeing all these thing\n--hearing too, the words of his father, and having a nearer view of\nhis way of life, and making comparisons of him and others --is drawn\nopposite ways: while his father is watering and nourishing the rational\nprinciple in his soul, the others are encouraging the passionate and\nappetitive; and he being not originally of a bad nature, but having\nkept bad company, is at last brought by their joint influence to a\nmiddle point, and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the\nmiddle principle of contentiousness and passion, and becomes arrogant\nand ambitious. \n\nYou seem to me to have described his origin perfectly. \nThen we have now, I said, the second form of government and the second\ntype of character? \n\nWe have. \nNext, let us look at another man who, as Aeschylus says,\n\nIs set over against another State; or rather, as our plan requires,\nbegin with the State. \n\nBy all means. \nI believe that oligarchy follows next in order. \nAnd what manner of government do you term oligarchy? \nA government resting on a valuation of property, in which the rich\nhave power and the poor man is deprived of it. \n\nI understand, he replied. \nOught I not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to\noligarchy arises? \n\nYes. \nWell, I said, no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes\ninto the other. \n\nHow? \nThe accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is\nruin the of timocracy; they invent illegal modes of expenditure; for\nwhat do they or their wives care about the law? \n\nYes, indeed. \nAnd then one, seeing another grow rich, seeks to rival him, and thus\nthe great mass of the citizens become lovers of money. \n\nLikely enough. \nAnd so they grow richer and richer, and the more they think of making\na fortune the less they think of virtue; for when riches and virtue\nare placed together in the scales of the balance, the one always rises\nas the other falls. \n\nTrue. \nAnd in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the State,\nvirtue and the virtuous are dishonoured. \n\nClearly. \nAnd what is honoured is cultivated, and that which has no honour is\nneglected. \n\nThat is obvious. \nAnd so at last, instead of loving contention and glory, men become\nlovers of trade and money; they honour and look up to the rich man,\nand make a ruler of him, and dishonour the poor man. \n\nThey do so. \nThey next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the\nqualification of citizenship; the sum is higher in one place and lower\nin another, as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive; and they allow\nno one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share\nin the government. These changes in the constitution they effect by\nforce of arms, if intimidation has not already done their work.\n\nVery true. \nAnd this, speaking generally, is the way in which oligarchy is established.\n\nYes, he said; but what are the characteristics of this form of government,\nand what are the defects of which we were speaking? \n\nFirst of all, I said, consider the nature of the qualification just\nthink what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their\nproperty, and a poor man were refused permission to steer, even though\nhe were a better pilot? \n\nYou mean that they would shipwreck? \nYes; and is not this true of the government of anything?\n\nI should imagine so. \nExcept a city? --or would you include a city? \nNay, he said, the case of a city is the strongest of all, inasmuch\nas the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all.\n\nThis, then, will be the first great defect of oligarchy?\n\nClearly. \nAnd here is another defect which is quite as bad. \nWhat defect? \nThe inevitable division: such a State is not one, but two States,\nthe one of poor, the other of rich men; and they are living on the\nsame spot and always conspiring against one another. \n\nThat, surely, is at least as bad. \nAnother discreditable feature is, that, for a like reason, they are\nincapable of carrying on any war. Either they arm the multitude, and\nthen they are more afraid of them than of the enemy; or, if they do\nnot call them out in the hour of battle, they are oligarchs indeed,\nfew to fight as they are few to rule. And at the same time their fondness\nfor money makes them unwilling to pay taxes. \n\nHow discreditable! \nAnd, as we said before, under such a constitution the same persons\nhave too many callings --they are husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors,\nall in one. Does that look well? \n\nAnything but well. \nThere is another evil which is, perhaps, the greatest of all, and\nto which this State first begins to be liable. \n\nWhat evil? \nA man may sell all that he has, and another may acquire his property;\nyet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer\na part, being neither trader, nor artisan, nor horseman, nor hoplite,\nbut only a poor, helpless creature. \n\nYes, that is an evil which also first begins in this State.\n\nThe evil is certainly not prevented there; for oligarchies have both\nthe extremes of great wealth and utter poverty. \n\nTrue. \nBut think again: In his wealthy days, while he was spending his money,\nwas a man of this sort a whit more good to the State for the purposes\nof citizenship? Or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body,\nalthough in truth he was neither ruler nor subject, but just a spendthrift?\n\nAs you say, he seemed to be a ruler, but was only a spendthrift.\n\nMay we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the\ndrone in the honeycomb, and that the one is the plague of the city\nas the other is of the hive? \n\nJust so, Socrates. \nAnd God has made the flying drones, Adeimantus, all without stings,\nwhereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but\nothers have dreadful stings; of the stingless class are those who\nin their old age end as paupers; of the stingers come all the criminal\nclass, as they are termed. \n\nMost true, he said. \nClearly then, whenever you see paupers in a State, somewhere in that\nneighborhood there are hidden away thieves, and cutpurses and robbers\nof temples, and all sorts of malefactors. \n\nClearly. \nWell, I said, and in oligarchical States do you not find paupers?\n\nYes, he said; nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler.\n\nAnd may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals\nto be found in them, rogues who have stings, and whom the authorities\nare careful to restrain by force? \n\nCertainly, we may be so bold. \nThe existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education,\nill-training, and an evil constitution of the State? \n\nTrue. \nSuch, then, is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy; and there\nmay be many other evils. \n\nVery likely. \nThen oligarchy, or the form of government in which the rulers are\nelected for their wealth, may now be dismissed. Let us next proceed\nto consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to\nthis State. \n\nBy all means. \nDoes not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this\nwise? \n\nHow? \nA time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son: at\nfirst he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps,\nbut presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the State\nas upon a sunken reef, and he and all that he has is lost; he may\nhave been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial\nunder a prejudice raised by informers, and either put to death, or\nexiled, or deprived of the privileges of a citizen, and all his property\ntaken from him. \n\nNothing more likely. \nAnd the son has seen and known all this --he is a ruined man, and\nhis fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion head-foremost\nfrom his bosom's throne; humbled by poverty he takes to money-making\nand by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together.\nIs not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element\non the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within\nhim, girt with tiara and chain and scimitar? \n\nMost true, he replied. \nAnd when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently\non either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know their place,\nhe compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned\ninto larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and admire\nanything but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so\nmuch as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.\n\nOf all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the\nconversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one.\n\nAnd the avaricious, I said, is the oligarchical youth? \nYes, he said; at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like\nthe State out of which oligarchy came. \n\nLet us then consider whether there is any likeness between them.\n\nVery good. \nFirst, then, they resemble one another in the value which they set\nupon wealth? \n\nCertainly. \nAlso in their penurious, laborious character; the individual only\nsatisfies his necessary appetites, and confines his expenditure to\nthem; his other desires he subdues, under the idea that they are unprofitable.\n\nTrue. \nHe is a shabby fellow, who saves something out of everything and makes\na purse for himself; and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud.\nIs he not a true image of the State which he represents?\n\nHe appears to me to be so; at any rate money is highly valued by him\nas well as by the State. \n\nYou see that he is not a man of cultivation, I said. \nI imagine not, he said; had he been educated he would never have made\na blind god director of his chorus, or given him chief honour.\n\nExcellent! I said. Yet consider: Must we not further admit that owing\nto this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires\nas of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general\nhabit of life? \n\nTrue. \nDo you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his\nrogueries? \n\nWhere must I look? \nYou should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly,\nas in the guardianship of an orphan. \n\nAye. \nIt will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give\nhim a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced\nvirtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by\nreason, but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he\ntrembles for his possessions. \n\nTo be sure. \nYes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires\nof the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to\nspend what is not his own. \n\nYes, and they will be strong in him too. \nThe man, then, will be at war with himself; he will be two men, and\nnot one; but, in general, his better desires will be found to prevail\nover his inferior ones. \n\nTrue. \nFor these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people;\nyet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far\naway and never come near him. \n\nI should expect so. \nAnd surely, the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in\na State for any prize of victory, or other object of honourable ambition;\nhe will not spend his money in the contest for glory; so afraid is\nhe of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help\nand join in the struggle; in true oligarchical fashion he fights with\na small part only of his resources, and the result commonly is that\nhe loses the prize and saves his money. \n\nVery true. \nCan we any longer doubt, then, that the miser and money-maker answers\nto the oligarchical State? \n\nThere can be no doubt. \nNext comes democracy; of this the origin and nature have still to\nbe considered by us; and then we will enquire into the ways of the\ndemocratic man, and bring him up for judgement. \n\nThat, he said, is our method. \nWell, I said, and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy\narise? Is it not on this wise? --The good at which such a State alms\nis to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?\n\nWhat then? \nThe rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth,\nrefuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth\nbecause they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and\nbuy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?\n\nTo be sure. \nThere can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation\ncannot exist together in citizens of the same State to any considerable\nextent; one or the other will be disregarded. \n\nThat is tolerably clear. \nAnd in oligarchical States, from the general spread of carelessness\nand extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?\n\nYes, often. \nAnd still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting\nand fully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their\ncitizenship; a third class are in both predicaments; and they hate\nand conspire against those who have got their property, and against\neverybody else, and are eager for revolution. \n\nThat is true. \nOn the other hand, the men of business, stooping as they walk, and\npretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined, insert\ntheir sting --that is, their money --into some one else who is not\non his guard against them, and recover the parent sum many times over\nmultiplied into a family of children: and so they make drone and pauper\nto abound in the State. \n\nYes, he said, there are plenty of them --that is certain.\n\nThe evil blazes up like a fire; and they will not extinguish it, either\nby restricting a man's use of his own property, or by another remedy:\n\nWhat other? \nOne which is the next best, and has the advantage of compelling the\ncitizens to look to their characters: --Let there be a general rule\nthat every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk,\nand there will be less of this scandalous money-making, and the evils\nof which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the State.\n\nYes, they will be greatly lessened. \nAt present the governors, induced by the motives which I have named,\ntreat their subjects badly; while they and their adherents, especially\nthe young men of the governing class, are habituated to lead a life\nof luxury and idleness both of body and mind; they do nothing, and\nare incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain. \n\nVery true. \nThey themselves care only for making money, and are as indifferent\nas the pauper to the cultivation of virtue. \n\nYes, quite as indifferent. \nSuch is the state of affairs which prevails among them. And often\nrulers and their subjects may come in one another's way, whether on\na pilgrimage or a march, as fellow-soldiers or fellow-sailors; aye,\nand they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment\nof danger --for where danger is, there is no fear that the poor will\nbe despised by the rich --and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man\nmay be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never\nspoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh --when he\nsees such an one puffing and at his wit's end, how can he avoid drawing\nthe conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has\nthe courage to despoil them? And when they meet in private will not\npeople be saying to one another 'Our warriors are not good for much'?\n\nYes, he said, I am quite aware that this is their way of talking.\n\nAnd, as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without\nmay bring on illness, and sometimes even when there is no external\nprovocation a commotion may arise within-in the same way wherever\nthere is weakness in the State there is also likely to be illness,\nof which the occasions may be very slight, the one party introducing\nfrom without their oligarchical, the other their democratical allies,\nand then the State falls sick, and is at war with herself; and may\nbe at times distracted, even when there is no external cause.\n\nYes, surely. \nAnd then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered\ntheir opponents, slaughtering some and banishing some, while to the\nremainder they give an equal share of freedom and power; and this\nis the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected\nby lot. \n\nYes, he said, that is the nature of democracy, whether the revolution\nhas been effected by arms, or whether fear has caused the opposite\nparty to withdraw. \n\nAnd now what is their manner of life, and what sort of a government\nhave they? for as the government is, such will be the man.\n\nClearly, he said. \nIn the first place, are they not free; and is not the city full of\nfreedom and frankness --a man may say and do what he likes?\n\n'Tis said so, he replied. \nAnd where freedom is, the individual is clearly able to order for\nhimself his own life as he pleases? \n\nClearly. \nThen in this kind of State there will be the greatest variety of human\nnatures? \n\nThere will. \nThis, then, seems likely to be the fairest of States, being an embroidered\nrobe which is spangled with every sort of flower. And just as women\nand children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming,\nso there are many men to whom this State, which is spangled with the\nmanners and characters of mankind, will appear to be the fairest of\nStates. \n\nYes. \nYes, my good Sir, and there will be no better in which to look for\na government. \n\nWhy? \nBecause of the liberty which reigns there --they have a complete assortment\nof constitutions; and he who has a mind to establish a State, as we\nhave been doing, must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at\nwhich they sell them, and pick out the one that suits him; then, when\nhe has made his choice, he may found his State. \n\nHe will be sure to have patterns enough. \nAnd there being no necessity, I said, for you to govern in this State,\neven if you have the capacity, or to be governed, unless you like,\nor go to war when the rest go to war, or to be at peace when others\nare at peace, unless you are so disposed --there being no necessity\nalso, because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast,\nthat you should not hold office or be a dicast, if you have a fancy\n--is not this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful\n\nFor the moment, yes. \nAnd is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?\nHave you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons, although\nthey have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are\nand walk about the world --the gentleman parades like a hero, and\nnobody sees or cares? \n\nYes, he replied, many and many a one. \nSee too, I said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't\ncare' about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the\nfine principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the\ncity --as when we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted\nnature, there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood\nbeen used to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and\na study --how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours\nunder her feet, never giving a thought to the pursuits which make\na statesman, and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the\npeople's friend. \n\nYes, she is of a noble spirit. \nThese and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which\nis a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and\ndispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.\n\nWe know her well. \nConsider now, I said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather\nconsider, as in the case of the State, how he comes into being.\n\nVery good, he said. \nIs not this the way --he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical\nfather who has trained him in his own habits? \n\nExactly. \nAnd, like his father, he keeps under by force the pleasures which\nare of the spending and not of the getting sort, being those which\nare called unnecessary? \n\nObviously. \nWould you like, for the sake of clearness, to distinguish which are\nthe necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures? \n\nI should. \nAre not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid, and\nof which the satisfaction is a benefit to us? And they are rightly\nso, because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial\nand what is necessary, and cannot help it. \n\nTrue. \nWe are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary? \nWe are not. \nAnd the desires of which a man may get rid, if he takes pains from\nhis youth upwards --of which the presence, moreover, does no good,\nand in some cases the reverse of good --shall we not be right in saying\nthat all these are unnecessary? \n\nYes, certainly. \nSuppose we select an example of either kind, in order that we may\nhave a general notion of them? \n\nVery good. \nWill not the desire of eating, that is, of simple food and condiments,\nin so far as they are required for health and strength, be of the\nnecessary class? \n\nThat is what I should suppose. \nThe pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways; it does us good and\nit is essential to the continuance of life? \n\nYes. \nBut the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for\nhealth? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd the desire which goes beyond this, or more delicate food, or other\nluxuries, which might generally be got rid of, if controlled and trained\nin youth, and is hurtful to the body, and hurtful to the soul in the\npursuit of wisdom and virtue, may be rightly called unnecessary?\n\nVery true. \nMay we not say that these desires spend, and that the others make\nmoney because they conduce to production? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd of the pleasures of love, and all other pleasures, the same holds\ngood? \n\nTrue. \nAnd the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures\nand desires of this sort, and was the slave of the unnecessary desires,\nwhereas he who was subject o the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical?\n\nVery true. \nAgain, let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical:\nthe following, as I suspect, is commonly the process. \n\nWhat is the process? \nWhen a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing,\nin a vulgar and miserly way, has tasted drones' honey and has come\nto associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide\nfor him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure --then,\nas you may imagine, the change will begin of the oligarchical principle\nwithin him into the democratical? \n\nInevitably. \nAnd as in the city like was helping like, and the change was effected\nby an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens,\nso too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from\nwithout to assist the desires within him, that which is and alike\nagain helping that which is akin and alike? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within\nhim, whether the influence of a father or of kindred, advising or\nrebuking him, then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite\nfaction, and he goes to war with himself. \n\nIt must be so. \nAnd there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the\noligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished;\na spirit of reverence enters into the young man's soul and order is\nrestored. \n\nYes, he said, that sometimes happens. \nAnd then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh\nones spring up, which are akin to them, and because he, their father,\ndoes not know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.\n\nYes, he said, that is apt to be the way. \nThey draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse\nwith them, breed and multiply in him. \n\nVery true. \nAt length they seize upon the citadel of the young man's soul, which\nthey perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits\nand true words, which make their abode in the minds of men who are\ndear to the gods, and are their best guardians and sentinels.\n\nNone better. \nFalse and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their\nplace. \n\nThey are certain to do so. \nAnd so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters,\nand takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any\nhelp be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid\nvain conceits shut the gate of the king's fastness; and they will\nneither allow the embassy itself to enter, private if private advisers\noffer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or\nreceive them. There is a battle and they gain the day, and then modesty,\nwhich they call silliness, is ignominiously thrust into exile by them,\nand temperance, which they nickname unmanliness, is trampled in the\nmire and cast forth; they persuade men that moderation and orderly\nexpenditure are vulgarity and meanness, and so, by the help of a rabble\nof evil appetites, they drive them beyond the border. \n\nYes, with a will. \nAnd when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is\nnow in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries,\nthe next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy\nand waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads,\nand a great company with them, hymning their praises and calling them\nby sweet names; insolence they term breeding, and anarchy liberty,\nand waste magnificence, and impudence courage. And so the young man\npasses out of his original nature, which was trained in the school\nof necessity, into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary\npleasures. \n\nYes, he said, the change in him is visible enough. \nAfter this he lives on, spending his money and labour and time on\nunnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones; but if he\nbe fortunate, and is not too much disordered in his wits, when years\nhave elapsed, and the heyday of passion is over --supposing that he\nthen re-admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues, and\ndoes not wholly give himself up to their successors --in that case\nhe balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium, putting\nthe government of himself into the hands of the one which comes first\nand wins the turn; and when he has had enough of that, then into the\nhands of another; he despises none of them but encourages them all\nequally. \n\nVery true, he said. \nNeither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word\nof advice; if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions\nof good and noble desires, and others of evil desires, and that he\nought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others --whenever\nthis is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are\nall alike, and that one is as good as another. \n\nYes, he said; that is the way with him. \nYes, I said, he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the\nhour; and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute;\nthen he becomes a water-drinker, and tries to get thin; then he takes\na turn at gymnastics; sometimes idling and neglecting everything,\nthen once more living the life of a philosopher; often he-is busy\nwith politics, and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes\ninto his head; and, if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior,\noff he is in that direction, or of men of business, once more in that.\nHis life has neither law nor order; and this distracted existence\nhe terms joy and bliss and freedom; and so he goes on. \n\nYes, he replied, he is all liberty and equality. \nYes, I said; his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the\nlives of many; --he answers to the State which we described as fair\nand spangled. And many a man and many a woman will take him for their\npattern, and many a constitution and many an example of manners is\ncontained in him. \n\nJust so. \nLet him then be set over against democracy; he may truly be called\nthe democratic man. \n\nLet that be his place, he said. \nLast of all comes the most beautiful of all, man and State alike,\ntyranny and the tyrant; these we have now to consider. \n\nQuite true, he said. \nSay then, my friend, in what manner does tyranny arise? --that it\nhas a democratic origin is evident. \n\nClearly. \nAnd does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy\nfrom oligarchy --I mean, after a sort? \n\nHow? \nThe good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which\nit was maintained was excess of wealth --am I not right?\n\nYes. \nAnd the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things\nfor the sake of money-getting was also the ruin of oligarchy?\n\nTrue. \nAnd democracy has her own good, of which the insatiable desire brings\nher to dissolution? \n\nWhat good? \nFreedom, I replied; which, as they tell you in a democracy, is the\nglory of the State --and that therefore in a democracy alone will\nthe freeman of nature deign to dwell. \n\nYes; the saying is in everybody's mouth. \nI was going to observe, that the insatiable desire of this and the\nneglect of other things introduces the change in democracy, which\noccasions a demand for tyranny. \n\nHow so? \nWhen a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cupbearers\npresiding over the feast, and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine\nof freedom, then, unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful\ndraught, she calls them to account and punishes them, and says that\nthey are cursed oligarchs. \n\nYes, he replied, a very common occurrence. \nYes, I said; and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves\nwho hug their chains and men of naught; she would have subjects who\nare like rulers, and rulers who are like subjects: these are men after\nher own heart, whom she praises and honours both in private and public.\nNow, in such a State, can liberty have any limit? \n\nCertainly not. \nBy degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses, and ends by\ngetting among the animals and infecting them. \n\nHow do you mean? \nI mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of\nhis sons and to fear them, and the son is on a level with his father,\nhe having no respect or reverence for either of his parents; and this\nis his freedom, and metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen\nwith the metic, and the stranger is quite as good as either.\n\nYes, he said, that is the way. \nAnd these are not the only evils, I said --there are several lesser\nones: In such a state of society the master fears and flatters his\nscholars, and the scholars despise their masters and tutors; young\nand old are all alike; and the young man is on a level with the old,\nand is ready to compete with him in word or deed; and old men condescend\nto the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety; they are loth\nto be thought morose and authoritative, and therefore they adopt the\nmanners of the young. \n\nQuite true, he said. \nThe last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with\nmoney, whether male or female, is just as free as his or her purchaser;\nnor must I forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes\nin relation to each other. \n\nWhy not, as Aeschylus says, utter the word which rises to our lips?\n\nThat is what I am doing, I replied; and I must add that no one who\ndoes not know would believe, how much greater is the liberty which\nthe animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy\nthan in any other State: for truly, the she-dogs, as the proverb says,\nare as good as their she-mistresses, and the horses and asses have\na way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen;\nand they will run at anybody who comes in their way if he does not\nleave the road clear for them: and all things are just ready to burst\nwith liberty. \n\nWhen I take a country walk, he said, I often experience what you describe.\nYou and I have dreamed the same thing. \n\nAnd above all, I said, and as the result of all, see how sensitive\nthe citizens become; they chafe impatiently at the least touch of\nauthority and at length, as you know, they cease to care even for\nthe laws, written or unwritten; they will have no one over them.\n\nYes, he said, I know it too well. \nSuch, my friend, I said, is the fair and glorious beginning out of\nwhich springs tyranny. \n\nGlorious indeed, he said. But what is the next step? \nThe ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy; the same disease magnified\nand intensified by liberty overmasters democracy --the truth being\nthat the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in\nthe opposite direction; and this is the case not only in the seasons\nand in vegetable and animal life, but above all in forms of government.\n\nTrue. \nThe excess of liberty, whether in States or individuals, seems only\nto pass into excess of slavery. \n\nYes, the natural order. \nAnd so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated\nform of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty?\n\nAs we might expect. \nThat, however, was not, as I believe, your question-you rather desired\nto know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy\nand democracy, and is the ruin of both? \n\nJust so, he replied. \nWell, I said, I meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts,\nof whom the more courageous are the-leaders and the more timid the\nfollowers, the same whom we were comparing to drones, some stingless,\nand others having stings. \n\nA very just comparison. \nThese two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are\ngenerated, being what phlegm and bile are to the body. And the good\nphysician and lawgiver of the State ought, like the wise bee-master,\nto keep them at a distance and prevent, if possible, their ever coming\nin; and if they have anyhow found a way in, then he should have them\nand their cells cut out as speedily as possible. \n\nYes, by all means, he said. \nThen, in order that we may see clearly what we are doing, let us imagine\ndemocracy to be divided, as indeed it is, into three classes; for\nin the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic\nthan there were in the oligarchical State. \n\nThat is true. \nAnd in the democracy they are certainly more intensified.\n\nHow so? \nBecause in the oligarchical State they are disqualified and driven\nfrom office, and therefore they cannot train or gather strength; whereas\nin a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power, and while\nthe keener sort speak and act, the rest keep buzzing about the bema\nand do not suffer a word to be said on the other side; hence in democracies\nalmost everything is managed by the drones. \n\nVery true, he said. \nThen there is another class which is always being severed from the\nmass. \n\nWhat is that? \nThey are the orderly class, which in a nation of traders sure to be\nthe richest. \n\nNaturally so. \nThey are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount\nof honey to the drones. \n\nWhy, he said, there is little to be squeezed out of people who have\nlittle. \n\nAnd this is called the wealthy class, and the drones feed upon them.\n\nThat is pretty much the case, he said. \nThe people are a third class, consisting of those who work with their\nown hands; they are not politicians, and have not much to live upon.\nThis, when assembled, is the largest and most powerful class in a\ndemocracy. \n\nTrue, he said; but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate\nunless they get a little honey. \n\nAnd do they not share? I said. Do not their leaders deprive the rich\nof their estates and distribute them among the people; at the same\ntime taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves?\n\nWhy, yes, he said, to that extent the people do share. \nAnd the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to\ndefend themselves before the people as they best can? \n\nWhat else can they do? \nAnd then, although they may have no desire of change, the others charge\nthem with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy?\nTrue. \n\nAnd the end is that when they see the people, not of their own accord,\nbut through ignorance, and because they are deceived by informers,\nseeking to do them wrong, then at last they are forced to become oligarchs\nin reality; they do not wish to be, but the sting of the drones torments\nthem and breeds revolution in them. \n\nThat is exactly the truth. \nThen come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another.\n\nTrue. \nThe people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse\ninto greatness. \n\nYes, that is their way. \nThis and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he\nfirst appears above ground he is a protector. \n\nYes, that is quite clear. \nHow then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant? Clearly when\nhe does what the man is said to do in the tale of the Arcadian temple\nof Lycaean Zeus. \n\nWhat tale? \nThe tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human\nvictim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to\nbecome a wolf. Did you never hear it? \n\nOh, yes. \nAnd the protector of the people is like him; having a mob entirely\nat his disposal, he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen;\nby the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court\nand murders them, making the life of man to disappear, and with unholy\ntongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizen; some he kills\nand others he banishes, at the same time hinting at the abolition\nof debts and partition of lands: and after this, what will be his\ndestiny? Must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies, or\nfrom being a man become a wolf --that is, a tyrant? \n\nInevitably. \nThis, I said, is he who begins to make a party against the rich?\n\nThe same. \nAfter a while he is driven out, but comes back, in spite of his enemies,\na tyrant full grown. \n\nThat is clear. \nAnd if they are unable to expel him, or to get him condemned to death\nby a public accusation, they conspire to assassinate him.\n\nYes, he said, that is their usual way. \nThen comes the famous request for a bodyguard, which is the device\nof all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career --'Let\nnot the people's friend,' as they say, 'be lost to them.'\n\nExactly. \nThe people readily assent; all their fears are for him --they have\nnone for themselves. \n\nVery true. \nAnd when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy\nof the people sees this, then, my friend, as the oracle said to Croesus,\n\nBy pebbly Hermus' shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed\nto be a coward. \n\nAnd quite right too, said he, for if he were, he would never be ashamed\nagain. \n\nBut if he is caught he dies. \nOf course. \nAnd he, the protector of whom we spoke, is to be seen, not 'larding\nthe plain' with his bulk, but himself the overthrower of many, standing\nup in the chariot of State with the reins in his hand, no longer protector,\nbut tyrant absolute. \n\nNo doubt, he said. \nAnd now let us consider the happiness of the man, and also of the\nState in which a creature like him is generated. \n\nYes, he said, let us consider that. \nAt first, in the early days of his power, he is full of smiles, and\nhe salutes every one whom he meets; --he to be called a tyrant, who\nis making promises in public and also in private! liberating debtors,\nand distributing land to the people and his followers, and wanting\nto be so kind and good to every one! \n\nOf course, he said. \nBut when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty,\nand there is nothing to fear from them, then he is always stirring\nup some war or other, in order that the people may require a leader.\n\nTo be sure. \nHas he not also another object, which is that they may be impoverished\nby payment of taxes, and thus compelled to devote themselves to their\ndaily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him? Clearly.\n\nAnd if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom,\nand of resistance to his authority, he will have a good pretext for\ndestroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy; and for\nall these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war.\n\nHe must. \nNow he begins to grow unpopular. \nA necessary result. \nThen some of those who joined in setting him up, and who are in power,\nspeak their minds to him and to one another, and the more courageous\nof them cast in his teeth what is being done. \n\nYes, that may be expected. \nAnd the tyrant, if he means to rule, must get rid of them; he cannot\nstop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything.\n\nHe cannot. \nAnd therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant, who is\nhigh-minded, who is wise, who is wealthy; happy man, he is the enemy\nof them all, and must seek occasion against them whether he will or\nno, until he has made a purgation of the State. \n\nYes, he said, and a rare purgation. \nYes, I said, not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of\nthe body; for they take away the worse and leave the better part,\nbut he does the reverse. \n\nIf he is to rule, I suppose that he cannot help himself.\n\nWhat a blessed alternative, I said: --to be compelled to dwell only\nwith the many bad, and to be by them hated, or not to live at all!\n\nYes, that is the alternative. \nAnd the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites\nand the greater devotion in them will he require? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd who are the devoted band, and where will he procure them?\n\nThey will flock to him, he said, of their own accord, if lie pays\nthem. \n\nBy the dog! I said, here are more drones, of every sort and from every\nland. \n\nYes, he said, there are. \nBut will he not desire to get them on the spot? \nHow do you mean? \nHe will rob the citizens of their slaves; he will then set them free\nand enrol them in his bodyguard. \n\nTo be sure, he said; and he will be able to trust them best of all.\n\nWhat a blessed creature, I said, must this tyrant be; he has put to\ndeath the others and has these for his trusted friends. \n\nYes, he said; they are quite of his sort. \nYes, I said, and these are the new citizens whom he has called into\nexistence, who admire him and are his companions, while the good hate\nand avoid him. \n\nOf course. \nVerily, then, tragedy is a wise thing and Euripides a great tragedian.\n\nWhy so? \nWhy, because he is the author of the pregnant saying, \n\nTyrants are wise by living with the wise; and he clearly meant to\nsay that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions.\n\nYes, he said, and he also praises tyranny as godlike; and many other\nthings of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets.\n\nAnd therefore, I said, the tragic poets being wise men will forgive\nus and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them\ninto our State, because they are the eulogists of tyranny.\n\nYes, he said, those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us.\n\nBut they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs, and\nhire voices fair and loud and persuasive, and draw the cities over\nto tyrannies and democracies. \n\nVery true. \nMoreover, they are paid for this and receive honour --the greatest\nhonour, as might be expected, from tyrants, and the next greatest\nfrom democracies; but the higher they ascend our constitution hill,\nthe more their reputation fails, and seems unable from shortness of\nbreath to proceed further. \n\nTrue. \nBut we are wandering from the subject: Let us therefore return and\nenquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various\nand ever-changing army of his. \n\nIf, he said, there are sacred treasures in the city, he will confiscate\nand spend them; and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons\nmay suffice, he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would\notherwise have to impose upon the people. \n\nAnd when these fail? \nWhy, clearly, he said, then he and his boon companions, whether male\nor female, will be maintained out of his father's estate.\n\nYou mean to say that the people, from whom he has derived his being,\nwill maintain him and his companions? \n\nYes, he said; they cannot help themselves. \nBut what if the people fly into a passion, and aver that a grown-up\nson ought not to be supported by his father, but that the father should\nbe supported by the son? The father did not bring him into being,\nor settle him in life, in order that when his son became a man he\nshould himself be the servant of his own servants and should support\nhim and his rabble of slaves and companions; but that his son should\nprotect him, and that by his help he might be emancipated from the\ngovernment of the rich and aristocratic, as they are termed. And so\nhe bids him and his companions depart, just as any other father might\ndrive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates.\n\nBy heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster he\nhas been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out,\nhe will find that he is weak and his son strong. \n\nWhy, you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence? What!\nbeat his father if he opposes him? \n\nYes, he will, having first disarmed him. \nThen he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and\nthis is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake:\nas the saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the\nslavery of freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny\nof slaves. Thus liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes\ninto the harshest and bitterest form of slavery. \n\nTrue, he said. \nVery well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed\nthe nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from democracy\nto tyranny? \n\nYes, quite enough, he said. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK IX\n\nSocrates - ADEIMANTUS \n\nLast of all comes the tyrannical man; about whom we have once more\nto ask, how is he formed out of the democratical? and how does he\nlive, in happiness or in misery? \n\nYes, he said, he is the only one remaining. \nThere is, however, I said, a previous question which remains unanswered.\n\nWhat question? \nI do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number\nof the appetites, and until this is accomplished the enquiry will\nalways be confused. \n\nWell, he said, it is not too late to supply the omission.\n\nVery true, I said; and observe the point which I want to understand:\nCertain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites I conceive to be\nunlawful; every one appears to have them, but in some persons they\nare controlled by the laws and by reason, and the better desires prevail\nover them-either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak;\nwhile in the case of others they are stronger, and there are more\nof them. \n\nWhich appetites do you mean? \nI mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling\npower is asleep; then the wild beast within us, gorged with meat or\ndrink, starts up and having shaken off sleep, goes forth to satisfy\nhis desires; and there is no conceivable folly or crime --not excepting\nincest or any other unnatural union, or parricide, or the eating of\nforbidden food --which at such a time, when he has parted company\nwith all shame and sense, a man may not be ready to commit.\n\nMost true, he said. \nBut when a man's pulse is healthy and temperate, and when before going\nto sleep he has awakened his rational powers, and fed them on noble\nthoughts and enquiries, collecting himself in meditation; after having\nfirst indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little, but\njust enough to lay them to sleep, and prevent them and their enjoyments\nand pains from interfering with the higher principle --which he leaves\nin the solitude of pure abstraction, free to contemplate and aspire\nto the knowledge of the unknown, whether in past, present, or future:\nwhen again he has allayed the passionate element, if he has a quarrel\nagainst any one --I say, when, after pacifying the two irrational\nprinciples, he rouses up the third, which is reason, before he takes\nhis rest, then, as you know, he attains truth most nearly, and is\nleast likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions.\n\nI quite agree. \nIn saying this I have been running into a digression; but the point\nwhich I desire to note is that in all of us, even in good men, there\nis a lawless wild-beast nature, which peers out in sleep. Pray, consider\nwhether I am right, and you agree with me. \n\nYes, I agree. \nAnd now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic\nman. He was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under\na miserly parent, who encouraged the saving appetites in him, but\ndiscountenanced the unnecessary, which aim only at amusement and ornament?\n\nTrue. \nAnd then he got into the company of a more refined, licentious sort\nof people, and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite\nextreme from an abhorrence of his father's meanness. At last, being\na better man than his corruptors, he was drawn in both directions\nuntil he halted midway and led a life, not of vulgar and slavish passion,\nbut of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures. After\nthis manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch?\n\nYes, he said; that was our view of him, and is so still.\n\nAnd now, I said, years will have passed away, and you must conceive\nthis man, such as he is, to have a son, who is brought up in his father's\nprinciples. \n\nI can imagine him. \nThen you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son\nwhich has already happened to the father: --he is drawn into a perfectly\nlawless life, which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty; and\nhis father and friends take part with his moderate desires, and the\nopposite party assist the opposite ones. As soon as these dire magicians\nand tyrant-makers find that they are losing their hold on him, they\ncontrive to implant in him a master passion, to be lord over his idle\nand spendthrift lusts --a sort of monstrous winged drone --that is\nthe only image which will adequately describe him. \n\nYes, he said, that is the only adequate image of him. \nAnd when his other lusts, amid clouds of incense and perfumes and\ngarlands and wines, and all the pleasures of a dissolute life, now\nlet loose, come buzzing around him, nourishing to the utmost the sting\nof desire which they implant in his drone-like nature, then at last\nthis lord of the soul, having Madness for the captain of his guard,\nbreaks out into a frenzy: and if he finds in himself any good opinions\nor appetites in process of formation, and there is in him any sense\nof shame remaining, to these better principles he puts an end, and\ncasts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in\nmadness to the full. \n\nYes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.\n\nAnd is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?\n\nI should not wonder. \nFurther, I said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?\n\nHe has. \nAnd you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind,\nwill fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over\nthe gods? \n\nThat he will. \nAnd the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being\nwhen, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he\nbecomes drunken, lustful, passionate? O my friend, is not that so?\n\nAssuredly. \nSuch is the man and such is his origin. And next, how does he live?\n\nSuppose, as people facetiously say, you were to tell me.\n\nI imagine, I said, at the next step in his progress, that there will\nbe feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans, and all that\nsort of thing; Love is the lord of the house within him, and orders\nall the concerns of his soul. \n\nThat is certain. \nYes; and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable,\nand their demands are many. \n\nThey are indeed, he said. \nHis revenues, if he has any, are soon spent. \nTrue. \nThen comes debt and the cutting down of his property. \nOf course. \nWhen he has nothing left, must not his desires, crowding in the nest\nlike young ravens, be crying aloud for food; and he, goaded on by\nthem, and especially by love himself, who is in a manner the captain\nof them, is in a frenzy, and would fain discover whom he can defraud\nor despoil of his property, in order that he may gratify them?\n\nYes, that is sure to be the case. \nHe must have money, no matter how, if he is to escape horrid pains\nand pangs. \n\nHe must. \nAnd as in himself there was a succession of pleasures, and the new\ngot the better of the old and took away their rights, so he being\nyounger will claim to have more than his father and his mother, and\nif he has spent his own share of the property, he will take a slice\nof theirs. \n\nNo doubt he will. \nAnd if his parents will not give way, then he will try first of all\nto cheat and deceive them. \n\nVery true. \nAnd if he fails, then he will use force and plunder them.\n\nYes, probably. \nAnd if the old man and woman fight for their own, what then, my friend?\nWill the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them?\n\nNay, he said, I should not feel at all comfortable about his parents.\n\nBut, O heavens! Adeimantus, on account of some newfangled love of\na harlot, who is anything but a necessary connection, can you believe\nthat he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary\nto his very existence, and would place her under the authority of\nthe other, when she is brought under the same roof with her; or that,\nunder like circumstances, he would do the same to his withered old\nfather, first and most indispensable of friends, for the sake of some\nnewly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable?\n\nYes, indeed, he said; I believe that he would. \nTruly, then, I said, a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father\nand mother. \n\nHe is indeed, he replied. \nHe first takes their property, and when that falls, and pleasures\nare beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul, then he breaks into\na house, or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer; next he\nproceeds to clear a temple. Meanwhile the old opinions which he had\nwhen a child, and which gave judgment about good and evil, are overthrown\nby those others which have just been emancipated, and are now the\nbodyguard of love and share his empire. These in his democratic days,\nwhen he was still subject to the laws and to his father, were only\nlet loose in the dreams of sleep. But now that he is under the dominion\nof love, he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then\nvery rarely and in a dream only; he will commit the foulest murder,\nor eat forbidden food, or be guilty of any other horrid act. Love\nis his tyrant, and lives lordly in him and lawlessly, and being himself\na king, leads him on, as a tyrant leads a State, to the performance\nof any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble\nof his associates, whether those whom evil communications have brought\nin from without, or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose\nwithin him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself. Have we\nnot here a picture of his way of life? \n\nYes, indeed, he said. \nAnd if there are only a few of them in the State, the rest of the\npeople are well disposed, they go away and become the bodyguard or\nmercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them\nfor a war; and if there is no war, they stay at home and do many little\npieces of mischief in the city. \n\nWhat sort of mischief? \nFor example, they are the thieves, burglars, cutpurses, footpads,\nrobbers of temples, man-stealers of the community; or if they are\nable to speak they turn informers, and bear false witness, and take\nbribes. \n\nA small catalogue of evils, even if the perpetrators of them are few\nin number. \n\nYes, I said; but small and great are comparative terms, and all these\nthings, in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a State, do\nnot come within a thousand miles of the tyrant; when this noxious\nclass and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their\nstrength, assisted by the infatuation of the people, they choose from\namong themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul,\nand him they create their tyrant. \n\nYes, he said, and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant.\n\nIf the people yield, well and good; but if they resist him, as he\nbegan by beating his own father and mother, so now, if he has the\npower, he beats them, and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland,\nas the Cretans say, in subjection to his young retainers whom he has\nintroduced to be their rulers and masters. This is the end of his\npassions and desires. \n\nExactly. \nWhen such men are only private individuals and before they get power,\nthis is their character; they associate entirely with their own flatterers\nor ready tools; or if they want anything from anybody, they in their\nturn are equally ready to bow down before them: they profess every\nsort of affection for them; but when they have gained their point\nthey know them no more. \n\nYes, truly. \nThey are always either the masters or servants and never the friends\nof anybody; the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship.\n\nCertainly not. \nAnd may we not rightly call such men treacherous? \nNo question. \nAlso they are utterly unjust, if we were right in our notion of justice?\n\nYes, he said, and we were perfectly right. \nLet us then sum up in a word, I said, the character of the worst man:\nhe is the waking reality of what we dreamed. \n\nMost true. \nAnd this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule, and\nthe longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes. \n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nThat is certain, said Glaucon, taking his turn to answer.\n\nAnd will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest, be also the\nmost miserable? and he who has tyrannized longest and most, most continually\nand truly miserable; although this may not be the opinion of men in\ngeneral? \n\nYes, he said, inevitably. \nAnd must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical, State, and\nthe democratical man like the democratical State; and the same of\nthe others? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd as State is to State in virtue and happiness, so is man in relation\nto man? \n\nTo be sure. \nThen comparing our original city, which was under a king, and the\ncity which is under a tyrant, how do they stand as to virtue?\n\nThey are the opposite extremes, he said, for one is the very best\nand the other is the very worst. \n\nThere can be no mistake, I said, as to which is which, and therefore\nI will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision\nabout their relative happiness and misery. And here we must not allow\nourselves to be panic-stricken at the apparition of the tyrant, who\nis only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him; but\nlet us go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about,\nand then we will give our opinion. \n\nA fair invitation, he replied; and I see, as every one must, that\na tyranny is the wretchedest form of government, and the rule of a\nking the happiest. \n\nAnd in estimating the men too, may I not fairly make a like request,\nthat I should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through\nhuman nature? He must not be like a child who looks at the outside\nand is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes\nto the beholder, but let him be one who has a clear insight. May I\nsuppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one\nwho is able to judge, and has dwelt in the same place with him, and\nbeen present at his dally life and known him in his family relations,\nwhere he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire, and again in\nthe hour of public danger --he shall tell us about the happiness and\nmisery of the tyrant when compared with other men? \n\nThat again, he said, is a very fair proposal. \nShall I assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and\nhave before now met with such a person? We shall then have some one\nwho will answer our enquiries. \n\nBy all means. \nLet me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the\nState; bearing this in mind, and glancing in turn from one to the\nother of them, will you tell me their respective conditions?\n\nWhat do you mean? he asked. \nBeginning with the State, I replied, would you say that a city which\nis governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved? \n\nNo city, he said, can be more completely enslaved. \nAnd yet, as you see, there are freemen as well as masters in such\na State? \n\nYes, he said, I see that there are --a few; but the people, speaking\ngenerally, and the best of them, are miserably degraded and enslaved.\n\nThen if the man is like the State, I said, must not the same rule\nprevail? his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity --the best elements\nin him are enslaved; and there is a small ruling part, which is also\nthe worst and maddest. \n\nInevitably. \nAnd would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman,\nor of a slave? \n\nHe has the soul of a slave, in my opinion. \nAnd the State which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable\nof acting voluntarily? \n\nUtterly incapable. \nAnd also the soul which is under a tyrant (I am speaking of the soul\ntaken as a whole) is least capable of doing what she desires; there\nis a gadfly which goads her, and she is full of trouble and remorse?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor? \nPoor. \nAnd the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable?\n\nTrue. \nAnd must not such a State and such a man be always full of fear?\n\nYes, indeed. \nIs there any State in which you will find more of lamentation and\nsorrow and groaning and pain? \n\nCertainly not. \nAnd is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery\nthan in the tyrannical man, who is in a fury of passions and desires?\n\nImpossible. \nReflecting upon these and similar evils, you held the tyrannical State\nto be the most miserable of States? \n\nAnd I was right, he said. \nCertainly, I said. And when you see the same evils in the tyrannical\nman, what do you say of him? \n\nI say that he is by far the most miserable of all men. \nThere, I said, I think that you are beginning to go wrong.\n\nWhat do you mean? \nI do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery.\n\nThen who is more miserable? \nOne of whom I am about to speak. \nWho is that? \nHe who is of a tyrannical nature, and instead of leading a private\nlife has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public\ntyrant. \n\nFrom what has been said, I gather that you are right. \nYes, I replied, but in this high argument you should be a little more\ncertain, and should not conjecture only; for of all questions, this\nrespecting good and evil is the greatest. \n\nVery true, he said. \nLet me then offer you an illustration, which may, I think, throw a\nlight upon this subject. \n\nWhat is your illustration? \nThe case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves: from\nthem you may form an idea of the tyrant's condition, for they both\nhave slaves; the only difference is that he has more slaves.\n\nYes, that is the difference. \nYou know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from\ntheir servants? \n\nWhat should they fear? \nNothing. But do you observe the reason of this? \nYes; the reason is, that the whole city is leagued together for the\nprotection of each individual. \n\nVery true, I said. But imagine one of these owners, the master say\nof some fifty slaves, together with his family and property and slaves,\ncarried off by a god into the wilderness, where there are no freemen\nto help him --will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife\nand children should be put to death by his slaves? \n\nYes, he said, he will be in the utmost fear. \nThe time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of\nhis slaves, and make many promises to them of freedom and other things,\nmuch against his will --he will have to cajole his own servants.\n\nYes, he said, that will be the only way of saving himself.\n\nAnd suppose the same god, who carried him away, to surround him with\nneighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another,\nand who, if they could catch the offender, would take his life?\n\nHis case will be still worse, if you suppose him to be everywhere\nsurrounded and watched by enemies. \n\nAnd is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound\n--he who being by nature such as we have described, is full of all\nsorts of fears and lusts? His soul is dainty and greedy, and yet alone,\nof all men in the city, he is never allowed to go on a journey, or\nto see the things which other freemen desire to see, but he lives\nin his hole like a woman hidden in the house, and is jealous of any\nother citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest.\n\nVery true, he said. \nAnd amid evils such as these will not he who is ill-governed in his\nown person --the tyrannical man, I mean --whom you just now decided\nto be the most miserable of all --will not he be yet more miserable\nwhen, instead of leading a private life, he is constrained by fortune\nto be a public tyrant? He has to be master of others when he is not\nmaster of himself: he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled\nto pass his life, not in retirement, but fighting and combating with\nother men. \n\nYes, he said, the similitude is most exact. \nIs not his case utterly miserable? and does not the actual tyrant\nlead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst?\n\nCertainly. \nHe who is the real tyrant, whatever men may think, is the real slave,\nand is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility, and\nto be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind. He has desires which\nhe is utterly unable to satisfy, and has more wants than any one,\nand is truly poor, if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him:\nall his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions,\nand distractions, even as the State which he resembles: and surely\nthe resemblance holds? \n\nVery true, he said. \nMoreover, as we were saying before, he grows worse from having power:\nhe becomes and is of necessity more jealous, more faithless, more\nunjust, more friendless, more impious, than he was at first; he is\nthe purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice, and the consequence\nis that he is supremely miserable, and that he makes everybody else\nas miserable as himself. \n\nNo man of any sense will dispute your words. \nCome then, I said, and as the general umpire in theatrical contests\nproclaims the result, do you also decide who in your opinion is first\nin the scale of happiness, and who second, and in what order the others\nfollow: there are five of them in all --they are the royal, timocratical,\noligarchical, democratical, tyrannical. \n\nThe decision will be easily given, he replied; they shall be choruses\ncoming on the stage, and I must judge them in the order in which they\nenter, by the criterion of virtue and vice, happiness and misery.\n\nNeed we hire a herald, or shall I announce, that the son of Ariston\n(the best) has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest,\nand that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself;\nand that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable,\nand that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also\nthe greatest tyrant of his State? \n\nMake the proclamation yourself, he said. \nAnd shall I add, 'whether seen or unseen by gods and men'?\n\nLet the words be added. \nThen this, I said, will be our first proof; and there is another,\nwhich may also have some weight. \n\nWhat is that? \nThe second proof is derived from the nature of the soul: seeing that\nthe individual soul, like the State, has been divided by us into three\nprinciples, the division may, I think, furnish a new demonstration.\n\nOf what nature? \nIt seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond;\nalso three desires and governing powers. \n\nHow do you mean? he said. \nThere is one principle with which, as we were saying, a man learns,\nanother with which he is angry; the third, having many forms, has\nno special name, but is denoted by the general term appetitive, from\nthe extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating\nand drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements\nof it; also money-loving, because such desires are generally satisfied\nby the help of money. \n\nThat is true, he said. \nIf we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part\nwere concerned with gain, we should then be able to fall back on a\nsingle notion; and might truly and intelligibly describe this part\nof the soul as loving gain or money. \n\nI agree with you. \nAgain, is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering\nand getting fame? \n\nTrue. \nSuppose we call it the contentious or ambitious --would the term be\nsuitable? \n\nExtremely suitable. \nOn the other hand, every one sees that the principle of knowledge\nis wholly directed to the truth, and cares less than either of the\nothers for gain or fame. \n\nFar less. \n'Lover of wisdom,' 'lover of knowledge,' are titles which we may fitly\napply to that part of the soul? \n\nCertainly. \nOne principle prevails in the souls of one class of men, another in\nothers, as may happen? \n\nYes. \nThen we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men\n--lovers of wisdom, lovers of honour, lovers of gain? \n\nExactly. \nAnd there are three kinds of pleasure, which are their several objects?\n\nVery true. \nNow, if you examine the three classes of men, and ask of them in turn\nwhich of their lives is pleasantest, each will be found praising his\nown and depreciating that of others: the money-maker will contrast\nthe vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the\nsolid advantages of gold and silver? \n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd the lover of honour --what will be his opinion? Will he not think\nthat the pleasure of riches is vulgar, while the pleasure of learning,\nif it brings no distinction, is all smoke and nonsense to him?\n\nVery true. \nAnd are we to suppose, I said, that the philosopher sets any value\non other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the\ntruth, and in that pursuit abiding, ever learning, not so far indeed\nfrom the heaven of pleasure? Does he not call the other pleasures\nnecessary, under the idea that if there were no necessity for them,\nhe would rather not have them? \n\nThere can be no doubt of that, he replied. \nSince, then, the pleasures of each class and the life of each are\nin dispute, and the question is not which life is more or less honourable,\nor better or worse, but which is the more pleasant or painless --how\nshall we know who speaks truly? \n\nI cannot myself tell, he said. \nWell, but what ought to be the criterion? Is any better than experience\nand wisdom and reason? \n\nThere cannot be a better, he said. \nThen, I said, reflect. Of the three individuals, which has the greatest\nexperience of all the pleasures which we enumerated? Has the lover\nof gain, in learning the nature of essential truth, greater experience\nof the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure\nof gain? \n\nThe philosopher, he replied, has greatly the advantage; for he has\nof necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his\nchildhood upwards: but the lover of gain in all his experience has\nnot of necessity tasted --or, I should rather say, even had he desired,\ncould hardly have tasted --the sweetness of learning and knowing truth.\n\nThen the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain,\nfor he has a double experience? \n\nYes, very great. \nAgain, has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour, or the\nlover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom? \n\nNay, he said, all three are honoured in proportion as they attain\ntheir object; for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man\nalike have their crowd of admirers, and as they all receive honour\nthey all have experience of the pleasures of honour; but the delight\nwhich is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the\nphilosopher only. \n\nHis experience, then, will enable him to judge better than any one?\n\nFar better. \nAnd he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience?\n\nCertainly. \nFurther, the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not\npossessed by the covetous or ambitious man, but only by the philosopher?\n\nWhat faculty? \nReason, with whom, as we were saying, the decision ought to rest.\n\nYes. \nAnd reasoning is peculiarly his instrument? \nCertainly. \nIf wealth and gain were the criterion, then the praise or blame of\nthe lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy? \n\nAssuredly. \nOr if honour or victory or courage, in that case the judgement of\nthe ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest? \n\nClearly. \nBut since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges--\n\nThe only inference possible, he replied, is that pleasures which are\napproved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.\n\nAnd so we arrive at the result, that the pleasure of the intelligent\npart of the soul is the pleasantest of the three, and that he of us\nin whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life.\n\nUnquestionably, he said, the wise man speaks with authority when he\napproves of his own life. \n\nAnd what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next, and the\npleasure which is next? \n\nClearly that of the soldier and lover of honour; who is nearer to\nhimself than the money-maker. \n\nLast comes the lover of gain? \nVery true, he said. \nTwice in succession, then, has the just man overthrown the unjust\nin this conflict; and now comes the third trial, which is dedicated\nto Olympian Zeus the saviour: a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure\nexcept that of the wise is quite true and pure --all others are a\nshadow only; and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive\nof falls? \n\nYes, the greatest; but will you explain yourself? \nI will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions.\n\nProceed. \nSay, then, is not pleasure opposed to pain? \nTrue. \nAnd there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain?\n\nThere is. \nA state which is intermediate, and a sort of repose of the soul about\neither --that is what you mean? \n\nYes. \nYou remember what people say when they are sick? \nWhat do they say? \nThat after all nothing is pleasanter than health. But then they never\nknew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill.\n\nYes, I know, he said. \nAnd when persons are suffering from acute pain, you must. have heard\nthem say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their\npain? \n\nI have. \nAnd there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest\nand cessation of pain, and not any positive enjoyment, is extolled\nby them as the greatest pleasure? \n\nYes, he said; at the time they are pleased and well content to be\nat rest. \n\nAgain, when pleasure ceases, that sort of rest or cessation will be\npainful? \n\nDoubtless, he said. \nThen the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also\nbe pain? \n\nSo it would seem. \nBut can that which is neither become both? \nI should say not. \nAnd both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul, are they not?\n\nYes. \nBut that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion,\nand in a mean between them? \n\nYes. \nHow, then, can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is\npleasure, or that the absence of pleasure is pain? \n\nImpossible. \nThis then is an appearance only and not a reality; that is tc say,\nthe rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful,\nand painful in comparison of what is pleasant; but all these representations,\nwhen tried by the test of true pleasure, are not real but a sort of\nimposition? \n\nThat is the inference. \nLook at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains\nand you will no longer suppose, as you perhaps may at present, that\npleasure is only the cessation of pain, or pain of pleasure.\n\nWhat are they, he said, and where shall I find them? \nThere are many of them: take as an example the pleasures, of smell,\nwhich are very great and have no antecedent pains; they come in a\nmoment, and when they depart leave no pain behind them. \n\nMost true, he said. \nLet us not, then, be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the\ncessation of pain, or pain of pleasure. \n\nNo. \nStill, the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul\nthrough the body are generally of this sort --they are reliefs of\npain. \n\nThat is true. \nAnd the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like\nnature? \n\nYes. \nShall I give you an illustration of them? \nLet me hear. \nYou would allow, I said, that there is in nature an upper and lower\nand middle region? \n\nI should. \nAnd if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region, would\nhe not imagine that he is going up; and he who is standing in the\nmiddle and sees whence he has come, would imagine that he is already\nin the upper region, if he has never seen the true upper world?\n\nTo be sure, he said; how can he think otherwise? \nBut if he were taken back again he would imagine, and truly imagine,\nthat he was descending? \n\nNo doubt. \nAll that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle\nand lower regions? \n\nYes. \nThen can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth,\nas they have wrong ideas about many other things, should also have\nwrong ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state; so\nthat when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel\npain and think the pain which they experience to be real, and in like\nmanner, when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state,\nthey firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and\npleasure; they, not knowing pleasure, err in contrasting pain with\nthe absence of pain. which is like contrasting black with grey instead\nof white --can you wonder, I say, at this? \n\nNo, indeed; I should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite.\n\nLook at the matter thus: --Hunger, thirst, and the like, are inanitions\nof the bodily state? \n\nYes. \nAnd ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul? \nTrue. \nAnd food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that\nwhich has more existence the truer? \n\nClearly, from that which has more. \nWhat classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your\njudgment --those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds\nof sustenance are examples, or the class which contains true opinion\nand knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue? Put\nthe question in this way: --Which has a more pure being --that which\nis concerned with the invariable, the immortal, and the true, and\nis of such a nature, and is found in such natures; or that which is\nconcerned with and found in the variable and mortal, and is itself\nvariable and mortal? \n\nFar purer, he replied, is the being of that which is concerned with\nthe invariable. \n\nAnd does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the\nsame degree as of essence? \n\nYes, of knowledge in the same degree. \nAnd of truth in the same degree? \nYes. \nAnd, conversely, that which has less of truth will also have less\nof essence? \n\nNecessarily. \nThen, in general, those kinds of things which are in the service of\nthe body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the\nservice of the soul? \n\nFar less. \nAnd has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul?\n\nYes. \nWhat is filled with more real existence, and actually has a more real\nexistence, is more really filled than that which is filled with less\nreal existence and is less real? \n\nOf course. \nAnd if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according\nto nature, that which is more really filled with more real being will\nmore really and truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas that which participates\nin less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied, and will\nparticipate in an illusory and less real pleasure? \n\nUnquestionably. \nThose then who know not wisdom and virtue, and are always busy with\ngluttony and sensuality, go down and up again as far as the mean;\nand in this region they move at random throughout life, but they never\npass into the true upper world; thither they neither look, nor do\nthey ever find their way, neither are they truly filled with true\nbeing, nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure. Like cattle,\nwith their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the\nearth, that is, to the dining-table, they fatten and feed and breed,\nand, in their excessive love of these delights, they kick and butt\nat one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron; and they\nkill one another by reason of their insatiable lust. For they fill\nthemselves with that which is not substantial, and the part of themselves\nwhich they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent. \n\nVerily, Socrates, said Glaucon, you describe the life of the many\nlike an oracle. \n\nTheir pleasures are mixed with pains --how can they be otherwise?\nFor they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured\nby contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant\nin the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought\nabout as Stesichorus says that the Greeks fought about the shadow\nof Helen at Troy in ignorance of the truth. \n\nSomething of that sort must inevitably happen. \nAnd must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element\nof the soul? Will not the passionate man who carries his passion into\naction, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious,\nor violent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking\nto attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without\nreason or sense? \n\nYes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.\n\nThen may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour,\nwhen they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company\nof reason and knowledge, and pursue after and win the pleasures which\nwisdom shows them, will also have the truest pleasures in the highest\ndegree which is attainable to them, inasmuch as they follow truth;\nand they will have the pleasures which are natural to them, if that\nwhich is best for each one is also most natural to him? \n\nYes, certainly; the best is the most natural. \nAnd when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle, and there\nis no division, the several parts are just, and do each of them their\nown business, and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of\nwhich they are capable? \n\nExactly. \nBut when either of the two other principles prevails, it fails in\nattaining its own pleasure, and compels the rest to pursue after a\npleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own?\n\nTrue. \nAnd the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy\nand reason, the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure?\n\nYes. \nAnd is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance\nfrom law and order? \n\nClearly. \nAnd the lustful and tyrannical desires are, as we saw, at the greatest\ndistance? Yes. \n\nAnd the royal and orderly desires are nearest? \nYes. \nThen the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural\npleasure, and the king at the least? \n\nCertainly. \nBut if so, the tyrant will live most unpleasantly, and the king most\npleasantly? \n\nInevitably. \nWould you know the measure of the interval which separates them?\n\nWill you tell me? \nThere appear to be three pleasures, one genuine and two spurious:\nnow the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious;\nhe has run away from the region of law and reason, and taken up his\nabode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites, and the\nmeasure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure.\n\nHow do you mean? \nI assume, I said, that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch;\nthe democrat was in the middle? \n\nYes. \nAnd if there is truth in what has preceded, he will be wedded to an\nimage of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure\nof the oligarch? \n\nHe will. \nAnd the oligarch is third from the royal; since we count as one royal\nand aristocratical? \n\nYes, he is third. \nThen the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number\nwhich is three times three? \n\nManifestly. \nThe shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of\nlength will be a plane figure. \n\nCertainly. \nAnd if you raise the power and make the plane a solid, there is no\ndifficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant\nis parted from the king. \n\nYes; the arithmetician will easily do the sum. \nOr if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval\nby which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure,\nhe will find him, when the multiplication is complete, living 729\ntimes more pleasantly, and the tyrant more painfully by this same\ninterval. \n\nWhat a wonderful calculation! And how enormous is the distance which\nseparates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain!\n\nYet a true calculation, I said, and a number which nearly concerns\nhuman life, if human beings are concerned with days and nights and\nmonths and years. \n\nYes, he said, human life is certainly concerned with them.\n\nThen if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the\nevil and unjust, his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety\nof life and in beauty and virtue? \n\nImmeasurably greater. \nWell, I said, and now having arrived at this stage of the argument,\nwe may revert to the words which brought us hither: Was not some one\nsaying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed\nto be just? \n\nYes, that was said. \nNow then, having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice,\nlet us have a little conversation with him. \n\nWhat shall we say to him? \nLet us make an image of the soul, that he may have his own words presented\nbefore his eyes. \n\nOf what sort? \nAn ideal image of the soul, like the composite creations of ancient\nmythology, such as the Chimera or Scylla or Cerberus, and there are\nmany others in which two or more different natures are said to grow\ninto one. \n\nThere are said of have been such unions. \nThen do you now model the form of a multitudinous, many-headed monster,\nhaving a ring of heads of all manner of beasts, tame and wild, which\nhe is able to generate and metamorphose at will. \n\nYou suppose marvellous powers in the artist; but, as language is more\npliable than wax or any similar substance, let there be such a model\nas you propose. \n\nSuppose now that you make a second form as of a lion, and a third\nof a man, the second smaller than the first, and the third smaller\nthan the second. \n\nThat, he said, is an easier task; and I have made them as you say.\n\nAnd now join them, and let the three grow into one. \nThat has been accomplished. \nNext fashion the outside of them into a single image, as of a man,\nso that he who is not able to look within, and sees only the outer\nhull, may believe the beast to be a single human creature. I have\ndone so, he said. \n\nAnd now, to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human\ncreature to be unjust, and unprofitable to be just, let us reply that,\nif he be right, it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous\nmonster and strengthen the lion and the lion-like qualities, but to\nstarve and weaken the man, who is consequently liable to be dragged\nabout at the mercy of either of the other two; and he is not to attempt\nto familiarize or harmonize them with one another --he ought rather\nto suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another.\n\nCertainly, he said; that is what the approver of injustice says.\n\nTo him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so\nspeak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the\nmost complete mastery over the entire human creature. \n\nHe should watch over the many-headed monster like a good husbandman,\nfostering and cultivating the gentle qualities, and preventing the\nwild ones from growing; he should be making the lion-heart his ally,\nand in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts\nwith one another and with himself. \n\nYes, he said, that is quite what the maintainer of justice say.\n\nAnd so from every point of view, whether of pleasure, honour, or advantage,\nthe approver of justice is right and speaks the truth, and the disapprover\nis wrong and false and ignorant. \n\nYes, from every point of view. \nCome, now, and let us gently reason with the unjust, who is not intentionally\nin error. 'Sweet Sir,' we will say to him, what think you of things\nesteemed noble and ignoble? Is not the noble that which subjects the\nbeast to the man, or rather to the god in man; and the ignoble that\nwhich subjects the man to the beast?' He can hardly avoid saying yes\n--can he now? \n\nNot if he has any regard for my opinion. \nBut, if he agree so far, we may ask him to answer another question:\n'Then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the\ncondition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst?\nWho can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery\nfor money, especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and\nevil men, would be the gainer, however large might be the sum which\nhe received? And will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff\nwho remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most\ngodless and detestable? Eriphyle took the necklace as the price of\nher husband's life, but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a\nworse ruin.' \n\nYes, said Glaucon, far worse --I will answer for him. \nHas not the intemperate been censured of old, because in him the huge\nmultiform monster is allowed to be too much at large? \n\nClearly. \nAnd men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent\nelement in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?\n\nYes. \nAnd luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken\nthis same creature, and make a coward of him? \n\nVery true. \nAnd is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates\nthe spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money,\nof which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his\nyouth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become\na monkey? \n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach Only because\nthey imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual\nis unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them,\nand his great study is how to flatter them. \n\nSuch appears to be the reason. \nAnd therefore, being desirous of placing him under a rule like that\nof the best, we say that he ought to be the servant of the best, in\nwhom the Divine rules; not, as Thrasymachus supposed, to the injury\nof the servant, but because every one had better be ruled by divine\nwisdom dwelling within him; or, if this be impossible, then by an\nexternal authority, in order that we may be all, as far as possible,\nunder the same government, friends and equals. \n\nTrue, he said. \nAnd this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is\nthe ally of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which\nwe exercise over children, and the refusal to let them be free until\nwe have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution\nof a state, and by cultivation of this higher element have set up\nin their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own, and when this is\ndone they may go their ways. \n\nYes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest. \nFrom what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that\na man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness,\nwhich will make him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power\nby his wickedness? \n\nFrom no point of view at all. \nWhat shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?\nHe who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who is detected and\npunished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized;\nthe gentler element in him is liberated, and his whole soul is perfected\nand ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom,\nmore than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty, strength\nand health, in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the\nbody. \n\nCertainly, he said. \nTo this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies\nof his life. And in the first place, he will honour studies which\nimpress these qualities on his soul and disregard others?\n\nClearly, he said. \nIn the next place, he will regulate his bodily habit and training,\nand so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures,\nthat he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter; his first\nobject will be not that he may be fair or strong or well, unless he\nis likely thereby to gain temperance, but he will always desire so\nto attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul?\n\nCertainly he will, if he has true music in him. \nAnd in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and\nharmony which he will also observe; he will not allow himself to be\ndazzled by the foolish applause of the world, and heap up riches to\nhis own infinite harm? \n\nCertainly not, he said. \nHe will look at the city which is within him, and take heed that no\ndisorder occur in it, such as might arise either from superfluity\nor from want; and upon this principle he will regulate his property\nand gain or spend according to his means. \n\nVery true. \nAnd, for the same reason, he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours\nas he deems likely to make him a better man; but those, whether private\nor public, which are likely to disorder his life, he will avoid?\n\nThen, if that is his motive, he will not be a statesman.\n\nBy the dog of Egypt, he will! in the city which 's his own he certainly\nwill, though in the land of his birth perhaps not, unless he have\na divine call. \n\nI understand; you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which\nwe are the founders, and which exists in idea only; for I do not believe\nthat there is such an one anywhere on earth? \n\nIn heaven, I replied, there is laid up a pattern of it, methinks,\nwhich he who desires may behold, and beholding, may set his own house\nin order. But whether such an one exists, or ever will exist in fact,\nis no matter; for he will live after the manner of that city, having\nnothing to do with any other. \n\nI think so, he said. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBOOK X\n\nSocrates - GLAUCON \n\nOf he many excellences which I perceive in the order of our State,\nthere is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule\nabout poetry. \n\nTo what do you refer? \nTo the rejection of imitative poetry, which certainly ought not to\nbe received; as I see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul\nhave been distinguished. \n\nWhat do you mean? \nSpeaking in confidence, for I should not like to have my words repeated\nto the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe --but I do not\nmind saying to you, that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the\nunderstanding of the hearers, and that the knowledge of their true\nnature is the only antidote to them. \n\nExplain the purport of your remark. \nWell, I will tell you, although I have always from my earliest youth\nhad an awe and love of Homer, which even now makes the words falter\non my lips, for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of\nthat charming tragic company; but a man is not to be reverenced more\nthan the truth, and therefore I will speak out. \n\nVery good, he said. \nListen to me then, or rather, answer me. \nPut your question. \nCan you tell me what imitation is? for I really do not know.\n\nA likely thing, then, that I should know. \nWhy not? for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the\nkeener. \n\nVery true, he said; but in your presence, even if I had any faint\nnotion, I could not muster courage to utter it. Will you enquire yourself?\n\nWell then, shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner: Whenever\na number of individuals have a common name, we assume them to have\nalso a corresponding idea or form. Do you understand me?\n\nI do. \nLet us take any common instance; there are beds and tables in the\nworld --plenty of them, are there not? \n\nYes. \nBut there are only two ideas or forms of them --one the idea of a\nbed, the other of a table. \n\nTrue. \nAnd the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for\nour use, in accordance with the idea --that is our way of speaking\nin this and similar instances --but no artificer makes the ideas themselves:\nhow could he? \n\nImpossible. \nAnd there is another artist, --I should like to know what you would\nsay of him. \n\nWho is he? \nOne who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen.\n\nWhat an extraordinary man! \nWait a little, and there will be more reason for your saying so. For\nthis is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind, but\nplants and animals, himself and all other things --the earth and heaven,\nand the things which are in heaven or under the earth; he makes the\ngods also. \n\nHe must be a wizard and no mistake. \nOh! you are incredulous, are you? Do you mean that there is no such\nmaker or creator, or that in one sense there might be a maker of all\nthese things but in another not? Do you see that there is a way in\nwhich you could make them all yourself? \n\nWhat way? \nAn easy way enough; or rather, there are many ways in which the feat\nmight be quickly and easily accomplished, none quicker than that of\nturning a mirror round and round --you would soon enough make the\nsun and the heavens, and the earth and yourself, and other animals\nand plants, and all the, other things of which we were just now speaking,\nin the mirror. \n\nYes, he said; but they would be appearances only. \nVery good, I said, you are coming to the point now. And the painter\ntoo is, as I conceive, just such another --a creator of appearances,\nis he not? \n\nOf course. \nBut then I suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue. And\nyet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed?\n\nYes, he said, but not a real bed. \nAnd what of the maker of the bed? Were you not saying that he too\nmakes, not the idea which, according to our view, is the essence of\nthe bed, but only a particular bed? \n\nYes, I did. \nThen if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence,\nbut only some semblance of existence; and if any one were to say that\nthe work of the maker of the bed, or of any other workman, has real\nexistence, he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth.\n\nAt any rate, he replied, philosophers would say that he was not speaking\nthe truth. \n\nNo wonder, then, that his work too is an indistinct expression of\ntruth. \n\nNo wonder. \nSuppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire\nwho this imitator is? \n\nIf you please. \nWell then, here are three beds: one existing in nature, which is made\nby God, as I think that we may say --for no one else can be the maker?\n\nNo. \nThere is another which is the work of the carpenter? \nYes. \nAnd the work of the painter is a third? \nYes. \nBeds, then, are of three kinds, and there are three artists who superintend\nthem: God, the maker of the bed, and the painter? \n\nYes, there are three of them. \nGod, whether from choice or from necessity, made one bed in nature\nand one only; two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor\never will be made by God. \n\nWhy is that? \nBecause even if He had made but two, a third would still appear behind\nthem which both of them would have for their idea, and that would\nbe the ideal bed and the two others. \n\nVery true, he said. \nGod knew this, and He desired to be the real maker of a real bed,\nnot a particular maker of a particular bed, and therefore He created\na bed which is essentially and by nature one only. \n\nSo we believe. \nShall we, then, speak of Him as the natural author or maker of the\nbed? \n\nYes, he replied; inasmuch as by the natural process of creation He\nis the author of this and of all other things. \n\nAnd what shall we say of the carpenter --is not he also the maker\nof the bed? \n\nYes. \nBut would you call the painter a creator and maker? \nCertainly not. \nYet if he is not the maker, what is he in relation to the bed?\n\nI think, he said, that we may fairly designate him as the imitator\nof that which the others make. \n\nGood, I said; then you call him who is third in the descent from nature\nan imitator? \n\nCertainly, he said. \nAnd the tragic poet is an imitator, and therefore, like all other\nimitators, he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth?\n\nThat appears to be so. \nThen about the imitator we are agreed. And what about the painter?\n--I would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which\noriginally exists in nature, or only the creations of artists?\n\nThe latter. \nAs they are or as they appear? You have still to determine this.\n\nWhat do you mean? \nI mean, that you may look at a bed from different points of view,\nobliquely or directly or from any other point of view, and the bed\nwill appear different, but there is no difference in reality. And\nthe same of all things. \n\nYes, he said, the difference is only apparent. \nNow let me ask you another question: Which is the art of painting\ndesigned to be --an imitation of things as they are, or as they appear\n--of appearance or of reality? \n\nOf appearance. \nThen the imitator, I said, is a long way off the truth, and can do\nall things because he lightly touches on a small part of them, and\nthat part an image. For example: A painter will paint a cobbler, carpenter,\nor any other artist, though he knows nothing of their arts; and, if\nhe is a good artist, he may deceive children or simple persons, when\nhe shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance, and they\nwill fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter. \n\nCertainly. \nAnd whenever any one informs us that he has found a man knows all\nthe arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single\nthing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man --whoever\ntells us this, I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature\nwho is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he\nmet, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable\nto analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.\n\nMost true. \nAnd so, when we hear persons saying that the tragedians, and Homer,\nwho is at their head, know all the arts and all things human, virtue\nas well as vice, and divine things too, for that the good poet cannot\ncompose well unless he knows his subject, and that he who has not\nthis knowledge can never be a poet, we ought to consider whether here\nalso there may not be a similar illusion. Perhaps they may have come\nacross imitators and been deceived by them; they may not have remembered\nwhen they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed\nfrom the truth, and could easily be made without any knowledge of\nthe truth, because they are appearances only and not realities? Or,\nafter all, they may be in the right, and poets do really know the\nthings about which they seem to the many to speak so well?\n\nThe question, he said, should by all means be considered.\n\nNow do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original\nas well as the image, he would seriously devote himself to the image-making\nbranch? Would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his\nlife, as if he had nothing higher in him? \n\nI should say not. \nThe real artist, who knew what he was imitating, would be interested\nin realities and not in imitations; and would desire to leave as memorials\nof himself works many and fair; and, instead of being the author of\nencomiums, he would prefer to be the theme of them. \n\nYes, he said, that would be to him a source of much greater honour\nand profit. \n\nThen, I said, we must put a question to Homer; not about medicine,\nor any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer: we\nare not going to ask him, or any other poet, whether he has cured\npatients like Asclepius, or left behind him a school of medicine such\nas the Asclepiads were, or whether he only talks about medicine and\nother arts at second hand; but we have a right to know respecting\nmilitary tactics, politics, education, which are the chiefest and\nnoblest subjects of his poems, and we may fairly ask him about them.\n'Friend Homer,' then we say to him, 'if you are only in the second\nremove from truth in what you say of virtue, and not in the third\n--not an image maker or imitator --and if you are able to discern\nwhat pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life,\ntell us what State was ever better governed by your help? The good\norder of Lacedaemon is due to Lycurgus, and many other cities great\nand small have been similarly benefited by others; but who says that\nyou have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good?\nItaly and Sicily boast of Charondas, and there is Solon who is renowned\namong us; but what city has anything to say about you?' Is there any\ncity which he might name? \n\nI think not, said Glaucon; not even the Homerids themselves pretend\nthat he was a legislator. \n\nWell, but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully\nby him, or aided by his counsels, when he was alive? \n\nThere is not. \nOr is there any invention of his, applicable to the arts or to human\nlife, such as Thales the Milesian or Anacharsis the Scythian, and\nother ingenious men have conceived, which is attributed to him?\n\nThere is absolutely nothing of the kind. \nBut, if Homer never did any public service, was he privately a guide\nor teacher of any? Had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate\nwith him, and who handed down to posterity an Homeric way of life,\nsuch as was established by Pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for\nhis wisdom, and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for\nthe order which was named after him? \n\nNothing of the kind is recorded of him. For surely, Socrates, Creophylus,\nthe companion of Homer, that child of flesh, whose name always makes\nus laugh, might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity, if, as\nis said, Homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own\nday when he was alive? \n\nYes, I replied, that is the tradition. But can you imagine, Glaucon,\nthat if Homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind\n--if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator --can\nyou imagine, I say, that he would not have had many followers, and\nbeen honoured and loved by them? Protagoras of Abdera, and Prodicus\nof Ceos, and a host of others, have only to whisper to their contemporaries:\n'You will never be able to manage either your own house or your own\nState until you appoint us to be your ministers of education' --and\nthis ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making them\nlove them that their companions all but carry them about on their\nshoulders. And is it conceivable that the contemporaries of Homer,\nor again of Hesiod, would have allowed either of them to go about\nas rhapsodists, if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous?\nWould they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold,\nand have compelled them to stay at home with them? Or, if the master\nwould not stay, then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere,\nuntil they had got education enough? \n\nYes, Socrates, that, I think, is quite true. \nThen must we not infer that all these poetical individuals, beginning\nwith Homer, are only imitators; they copy images of virtue and the\nlike, but the truth they never reach? The poet is like a painter who,\nas we have already observed, will make a likeness of a cobbler though\nhe understands nothing of cobbling; and his picture is good enough\nfor those who know no more than he does, and judge only by colours\nand figures. \n\nQuite so. \nIn like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to\nlay on the colours of the several arts, himself understanding their\nnature only enough to imitate them; and other people, who are as ignorant\nas he is, and judge only from his words, imagine that if he speaks\nof cobbling, or of military tactics, or of anything else, in metre\nand harmony and rhythm, he speaks very well --such is the sweet influence\nwhich melody and rhythm by nature have. And I think that you must\nhave observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of\npoets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them,\nand recited in simple prose. \n\nYes, he said. \nThey are like faces which were never really beautiful, but only blooming;\nand now the bloom of youth has passed away from them? \n\nExactly. \nHere is another point: The imitator or maker of the image knows nothing\nof true existence; he knows appearances only. Am I not right?\n\nYes. \nThen let us have a clear understanding, and not be satisfied with\nhalf an explanation. \n\nProceed. \nOf the painter we say that he will paint reins, and he will paint\na bit? \n\nYes. \nAnd the worker in leather and brass will make them? \nCertainly. \nBut does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins? Nay,\nhardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them; only the\nhorseman who knows how to use them --he knows their right form.\n\nMost true. \nAnd may we not say the same of all things? \nWhat? \nThat there are three arts which are concerned with all things: one\nwhich uses, another which makes, a third which imitates them?\n\nYes. \nAnd the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure, animate\nor inanimate, and of every action of man, is relative to the use for\nwhich nature or the artist has intended them. \n\nTrue. \nThen the user of them must have the greatest experience of them, and\nhe must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop\nthemselves in use; for example, the flute-player will tell the flute-maker\nwhich of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer; he will tell\nhim how he ought to make them, and the other will attend to his instructions?\n\nOf course. \nThe one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness\nand badness of flutes, while the other, confiding in him, will do\nwhat he is told by him? \n\nTrue. \nThe instrument is the same, but about the excellence or badness of\nit the maker will only attain to a correct belief; and this he will\ngain from him who knows, by talking to him and being compelled to\nhear what he has to say, whereas the user will have knowledge?\n\nTrue. \nBut will the imitator have either? Will he know from use whether or\nno his drawing is correct or beautiful? Or will he have right opinion\nfrom being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives\nhim instructions about what he should draw? \n\nNeither. \nThen he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge\nabout the goodness or badness of his imitations? \n\nI suppose not. \nThe imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence\nabout his own creations? \n\nNay, very much the reverse. \nAnd still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing\ngood or bad, and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which\nappears to be good to the ignorant multitude? \n\nJust so. \nThus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge\nworth mentioning of what he imitates. Imitation is only a kind of\nplay or sport, and the tragic poets, whether they write in iambic\nor in Heroic verse, are imitators in the highest degree?\n\nVery true. \nAnd now tell me, I conjure you, has not imitation been shown by us\nto be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth?\n\nCertainly. \nAnd what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed?\n\nWhat do you mean? \nI will explain: The body which is large when seen near, appears small\nwhen seen at a distance? \n\nTrue. \nAnd the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water,\nand crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing\nto the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every\nsort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness\nof the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by\nlight and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes, having an effect\nupon us like magic. \n\nTrue. \nAnd the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue\nof the human understanding-there is the beauty of them --and the apparent\ngreater or less, or more or heavier, no longer have the mastery over\nus, but give way before calculation and measure and weight?\n\nMost true. \nAnd this, surely, must be the work of the calculating and rational\nprinciple in the soul \n\nTo be sure. \nAnd when this principle measures and certifies that some things are\nequal, or that some are greater or less than others, there occurs\nan apparent contradiction? \n\nTrue. \nBut were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty\ncannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing?\n\nVery true. \nThen that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure\nis not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with\nmeasure? \n\nTrue. \nAnd the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts\nto measure and calculation? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles\nof the soul? \n\nNo doubt. \nThis was the conclusion at which I was seeking to arrive when I said\nthat painting or drawing, and imitation in general, when doing their\nown proper work, are far removed from truth, and the companions and\nfriends and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed\nfrom reason, and that they have no true or healthy aim. \n\nExactly. \nThe imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior, and has\ninferior offspring. \n\nVery true. \nAnd is this confined to the sight only, or does it extend to the hearing\nalso, relating in fact to what we term poetry? \n\nProbably the same would be true of poetry. \nDo not rely, I said, on a probability derived from the analogy of\npainting; but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with\nwhich poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad. \n\nBy all means. \nWe may state the question thus: --Imitation imitates the actions of\nmen, whether voluntary or involuntary, on which, as they imagine,\na good or bad result has ensued, and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly.\nIs there anything more? \n\nNo, there is nothing else. \nBut in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with\nhimself --or rather, as in the instance of sight there was confusion\nand opposition in his opinions about the same things, so here also\nis there not strife and inconsistency in his life? Though I need hardly\nraise the question again, for I remember that all this has been already\nadmitted; and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these\nand ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment?\n\nAnd we were right, he said. \nYes, I said, thus far we were right; but there was an omission which\nmust now be supplied. \n\nWhat was the omission? \nWere we not saying that a good man, who has the misfortune to lose\nhis son or anything else which is most dear to him, will bear the\nloss with more equanimity than another? \n\nYes. \nBut will he have no sorrow, or shall we say that although he cannot\nhelp sorrowing, he will moderate his sorrow? \n\nThe latter, he said, is the truer statement. \nTell me: will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his\nsorrow when he is seen by his equals, or when he is alone?\n\nIt will make a great difference whether he is seen or not.\n\nWhen he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things\nwhich he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do?\n\nTrue. \nThere is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist,\nas well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge\nhis sorrow? \n\nTrue. \nBut when a man is drawn in two opposite directions, to and from the\nsame object, this, as we affirm, necessarily implies two distinct\nprinciples in him? \n\nCertainly. \nOne of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law? \nHow do you mean? \nThe law would say that to be patient under suffering is best, and\nthat we should not give way to impatience, as there is no knowing\nwhether such things are good or evil; and nothing is gained by impatience;\nalso, because no human thing is of serious importance, and grief stands\nin the way of that which at the moment is most required.\n\nWhat is most required? he asked. \nThat we should take counsel about what has happened, and when the\ndice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems\nbest; not, like children who have had a fall, keeping hold of the\npart struck and wasting time in setting up a howl, but always accustoming\nthe soul forthwith to apply a remedy, raising up that which is sickly\nand fallen, banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art.\n\nYes, he said, that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune.\n\nYes, I said; and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion\nof reason? \n\nClearly. \nAnd the other principle, which inclines us to recollection of our\ntroubles and to lamentation, and can never have enough of them, we\nmay call irrational, useless, and cowardly? \n\nIndeed, we may. \nAnd does not the latter --I mean the rebellious principle --furnish\na great variety of materials for imitation? Whereas the wise and calm\ntemperament, being always nearly equable, is not easy to imitate or\nto appreciate when imitated, especially at a public festival when\na promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre. For the feeling represented\nis one to which they are strangers. \n\nCertainly. \nThen the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature\nmade, nor is his art intended, to please or to affect the principle\nin the soul; but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper,\nwhich is easily imitated? \n\nClearly. \nAnd now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter,\nfor he is like him in two ways: first, inasmuch as his creations have\nan inferior degree of truth --in this, I say, he is like him; and\nhe is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the\nsoul; and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into\na well-ordered State, because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens\nthe feelings and impairs the reason. As in a city when the evil are\npermitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way, so\nin the soul of man, as we maintain, the imitative poet implants an\nevil constitution, for he indulges the irrational nature which has\nno discernment of greater and less, but thinks the same thing at one\ntime great and at another small-he is a manufacturer of images and\nis very far removed from the truth. \n\nExactly. \nBut we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation:\n--the power which poetry has of harming even the good (and there are\nvery few who are not harmed), is surely an awful thing? \n\nYes, certainly, if the effect is what you say. \nHear and judge: The best of us, as I conceive, when we listen to a\npassage of Homer, or one of the tragedians, in which he represents\nsome pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration,\nor weeping, and smiting his breast --the best of us, you know, delight\nin giving way to sympathy, and are in raptures at the excellence of\nthe poet who stirs our feelings most. \n\nYes, of course I know. \nBut when any sorrow of our own happens to us, then you may observe\nthat we pride ourselves on the opposite quality --we would fain be\nquiet and patient; this is the manly part, and the other which delighted\nus in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman.\n\nVery true, he said. \nNow can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing\nthat which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his\nown person? \n\nNo, he said, that is certainly not reasonable. \nNay, I said, quite reasonable from one point of view. \nWhat point of view? \nIf you consider, I said, that when in misfortune we feel a natural\nhunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation,\nand that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities\nis satisfied and delighted by the poets;-the better nature in each\nof us, not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit, allows\nthe sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another's;\nand the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself\nin praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good\nman he is, and making a fuss about his troubles; he thinks that the\npleasure is a gain, and why should he be supercilious and lose this\nand the poem too? Few persons ever reflect, as I should imagine, that\nfrom the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves.\nAnd so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight\nof the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own.\n\nHow very true! \nAnd does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests\nwhich you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic\nstage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused\nby them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness; --the\ncase of pity is repeated; --there is a principle in human nature which\nis disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by\nreason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now\nlet out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre,\nyou are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic\npoet at home. \n\nQuite true, he said. \nAnd the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections,\nof desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable\nfrom every action ---in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions\ninstead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought\nto be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and\nvirtue. \n\nI cannot deny it. \nTherefore, Glaucon, I said, whenever you meet with any of the eulogists\nof Homer declaring that he has been the educator of Hellas, and that\nhe is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things,\nand that you should take him up again and again and get to know him\nand regulate your whole life according to him, we may love and honour\nthose who say these things --they are excellent people, as far as\ntheir lights extend; and we are ready to acknowledge that Homer is\nthe greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers; but we must remain\nfirm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous\nmen are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our State.\nFor if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter, either\nin epic or lyric verse, not law and the reason of mankind, which by\ncommon consent have ever been deemed best, but pleasure and pain will\nbe the rulers in our State. \n\nThat is most true, he said. \nAnd now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry, let this\nour defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment\nin sending away out of our State an art having the tendencies which\nwe have described; for reason constrained us. But that she may impute\nto us any harshness or want of politeness, let us tell her that there\nis an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry; of which there\nare many proofs, such as the saying of 'the yelping hound howling\nat her lord,' or of one 'mighty in the vain talk of fools,' and 'the\nmob of sages circumventing Zeus,' and the 'subtle thinkers who are\nbeggars after all'; and there are innumerable other signs of ancient\nenmity between them. Notwithstanding this, let us assure our sweet\nfriend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove\nher title to exist in a well-ordered State we shall be delighted to\nreceive her --we are very conscious of her charms; but we may not\non that account betray the truth. I dare say, Glaucon, that you are\nas much charmed by her as I am, especially when she appears in Homer?\n\nYes, indeed, I am greatly charmed. \nShall I propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but\nupon this condition only --that she make a defence of herself in lyrical\nor some other metre? \n\nCertainly. \nAnd we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers\nof poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her\nbehalf: let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful\nto States and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit;\nfor if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers --I mean,\nif there is a use in poetry as well as a delight? \n\nCertainly, he said, we shall the gainers. \nIf her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who\nare enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when\nthey think their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must\nwe after the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle.\nWe too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of\nnoble States has implanted in us, and therefore we would have her\nappear at her best and truest; but so long as she is unable to make\ngood her defence, this argument of ours shall be a charm to us, which\nwe will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains; that we\nmay not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the\nmany. At all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we\nhave described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the\ntruth; and he who listens to her, fearing for the safety of the city\nwhich is within him, should be on his guard against her seductions\nand make our words his law. \n\nYes, he said, I quite agree with you. \nYes, I said, my dear Glaucon, for great is the issue at stake, greater\nthan appears, whether a man is to be good or bad. And what will any\none be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power,\naye, or under the excitement of poetry, he neglect justice and virtue?\n\nYes, he said; I have been convinced by the argument, as I believe\nthat any one else would have been. \n\nAnd yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards\nwhich await virtue. \n\nWhat, are there any greater still? If there are, they must be of an\ninconceivable greatness. \n\nWhy, I said, what was ever great in a short time? The whole period\nof threescore years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison\nwith eternity? \n\nSay rather 'nothing,' he replied. \nAnd should an immortal being seriously think of this little space\nrather than of the whole? \n\nOf the whole, certainly. But why do you ask? \nAre you not aware, I said, that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable?\n\nHe looked at me in astonishment, and said: No, by heaven: And are\nyou really prepared to maintain this? \n\nYes, I said, I ought to be, and you too --there is no difficulty in\nproving it. \n\nI see a great difficulty; but I should like to hear you state this\nargument of which you make so light. \n\nListen then. \nI am attending. \nThere is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil?\n\nYes, he replied. \nWould you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying\nelement is the evil, and the saving and improving element the good?\n\nYes. \nAnd you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil; as ophthalmia\nis the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body; as mildew is\nof corn, and rot of timber, or rust of copper and iron: in everything,\nor in almost everything, there is an inherent evil and disease?\n\nYes, he said. \nAnd anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil,\nand at last wholly dissolves and dies? \n\nTrue. \nThe vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of\neach; and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that\nwill; for good certainly will not destroy them, nor again, that which\nis neither good nor evil. \n\nCertainly not. \nIf, then, we find any nature which having this inherent corruption\ncannot be dissolved or destroyed, we may be certain that of such a\nnature there is no destruction? \n\nThat may be assumed. \nWell, I said, and is there no evil which corrupts the soul?\n\nYes, he said, there are all the evils which we were just now passing\nin review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.\n\nBut does any of these dissolve or destroy her? --and here do not let\nus fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man,\nwhen he is detected, perishes through his own injustice, which is\nan evil of the soul. Take the analogy of the body: The evil of the\nbody is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body;\nand all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation\nthrough their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them\nand so destroying them. Is not this true? \n\nYes. \nConsider the soul in like manner. Does the injustice or other evil\nwhich exists in the soul waste and consume her? Do they by attaching\nto the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death, and so\nseparate her from the body ? \n\nCertainly not. \nAnd yet, I said, it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish\nfrom without through affection of external evil which could not be\ndestroyed from within by a corruption of its own? \n\nIt is, he replied. \nConsider, I said, Glaucon, that even the badness of food, whether\nstaleness, decomposition, or any other bad quality, when confined\nto the actual food, is not supposed to destroy the body; although,\nif the badness of food communicates corruption to the body, then we\nshould say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself,\nwhich is disease, brought on by this; but that the body, being one\nthing, can be destroyed by the badness of food, which is another,\nand which does not engender any natural infection --this we shall\nabsolutely deny? \n\nVery true. \nAnd, on the same principle, unless some bodily evil can produce an\nevil of the soul, we must not suppose that the soul, which is one\nthing, can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs\nto another? \n\nYes, he said, there is reason in that. \nEither then, let us refute this conclusion, or, while it remains unrefuted,\nlet us never say that fever, or any other disease, or the knife put\nto the throat, or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest\npieces, can destroy the soul, until she herself is proved to become\nmore unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done\nto the body; but that the soul, or anything else if not destroyed\nby an internal evil, can be destroyed by an external one, is not to.\nbe affirmed by any man. \n\nAnd surely, he replied, no one will ever prove that the souls of men\nbecome more unjust in consequence of death. \n\nBut if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the\nsoul boldly denies this, and says that the dying do really become\nmore evil and unrighteous, then, if the speaker is right, I suppose\nthat injustice, like disease, must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust,\nand that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent\npower of destruction which evil has, and which kills them sooner or\nlater, but in quite another way from that in which, at present, the\nwicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their\ndeeds? \n\nNay, he said, in that case injustice, if fatal to the unjust, will\nnot be so very terrible to him, for he will be delivered from evil.\nBut I rather suspect the opposite to be the truth, and that injustice\nwhich, if it have the power, will murder others, keeps the murderer\nalive --aye, and well awake too; so far removed is her dwelling-place\nfrom being a house of death. \n\nTrue, I said; if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is\nunable to kill or destroy her, hardly will that which is appointed\nto be the destruction of some other body, destroy a soul or anything\nelse except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction.\n\nYes, that can hardly be. \nBut the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil, whether inherent\nor external, must exist for ever, and if existing for ever, must be\nimmortal? \n\nCertainly. \nThat is the conclusion, I said; and, if a true conclusion, then the\nsouls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will\nnot diminish in number. Neither will they increase, for the increase\nof the immortal natures must come from something mortal, and all things\nwould thus end in immortality. \n\nVery true. \nBut this we cannot believe --reason will not allow us --any more than\nwe can believe the soul, in her truest nature, to be full of variety\nand difference and dissimilarity. \n\nWhat do you mean? he said. \nThe soul, I said, being, as is now proven, immortal, must be the fairest\nof compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements?\n\nCertainly not. \nHer immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument, and there\nare many other proofs; but to see her as she really is, not as we\nnow behold her, marred by communion with the body and other miseries,\nyou must contemplate her with the eye of reason, in her original purity;\nand then her beauty will be revealed, and justice and injustice and\nall the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly.\nThus far, we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at\npresent, but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a\ncondition which may be compared to that of the sea-god Glaucus, whose\noriginal image can hardly be discerned because his natural members\nare broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of\nways, and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells\nand stones, so that he is more like some monster than he is to his\nown natural form. And the soul which we behold is in a similar condition,\ndisfigured by ten thousand ills. But not there, Glaucon, not there\nmust we look. \n\nWhere then? \nAt her love of wisdom. Let us see whom she affects, and what society\nand converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal\nand eternal and divine; also how different she would become if wholly\nfollowing this superior principle, and borne by a divine impulse out\nof the ocean in which she now is, and disengaged from the stones and\nshells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up\naround her because she feeds upon earth, and is overgrown by the good\nthings of this life as they are termed: then you would see her as\nshe is, and know whether she has one shape only or many, or what her\nnature is. Of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this\npresent life I think that we have now said enough. \n\nTrue, he replied. \nAnd thus, I said, we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument;\nwe have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice, which,\nas you were saying, are to be found in Homer and Hesiod; but justice\nin her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own\nnature. Let a man do what is just, whether he have the ring of Gyges\nor not, and even if in addition to the ring of Gyges he put on the\nhelmet of Hades. \n\nVery true. \nAnd now, Glaucon, there will be no harm in further enumerating how\nmany and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues\nprocure to the soul from gods and men, both in life and after death.\n\nCertainly not, he said. \nWill you repay me, then, what you borrowed in the argument?\n\nWhat did I borrow? \nThe assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust\njust: for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case\ncould not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men, still this admission\nought to be made for the sake of the argument, in order that pure\njustice might be weighed against pure injustice. Do you remember?\n\nI should be much to blame if I had forgotten. \nThen, as the cause is decided, I demand on behalf of justice that\nthe estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge\nto be her due should now be restored to her by us; since she has been\nshown to confer reality, and not to deceive those who truly possess\nher, let what has been taken from her be given back, that so she may\nwin that palm of appearance which is hers also, and which she gives\nto her own. \n\nThe demand, he said, is just. \nIn the first place, I said --and this is the first thing which you\nwill have to give back --the nature both of the just and unjust is\ntruly known to the gods. \n\nGranted. \nAnd if they are both known to them, one must be the friend and the\nother the enemy of the gods, as we admitted from the beginning?\n\nTrue. \nAnd the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all\nthings at their best, excepting only such evil as is the necessary\nconsequence of former sins? \n\nCertainly. \nThen this must be our notion of the just man, that even when he is\nin poverty or sickness, or any other seeming misfortune, all things\nwill in the end work together for good to him in life and death: for\nthe gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and\nto be like God, as far as man can attain the divine likeness, by the\npursuit of virtue? \n\nYes, he said; if he is like God he will surely not be neglected by\nhim. \n\nAnd of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed? \nCertainly. \nSuch, then, are the palms of victory which the gods give the just?\n\nThat is my conviction. \nAnd what do they receive of men? Look at things as they really are,\nand you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners,\nwho run well from the starting-place to the goal but not back again\nfrom the goal: they go off at a great pace, but in the end only look\nfoolish, slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders,\nand without a crown; but the true runner comes to the finish and receives\nthe prize and is crowned. And this is the way with the just; he who\nendures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life\nhas a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow.\n\nTrue. \nAnd now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which\nyou were attributing to the fortunate unjust. I shall say of them,\nwhat you were saying of the others, that as they grow older, they\nbecome rulers in their own city if they care to be; they marry whom\nthey like and give in marriage to whom they will; all that you said\nof the others I now say of these. And, on the other hand, of the unjust\nI say that the greater number, even though they escape in their youth,\nare found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course,\nand when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger\nand citizen; they are beaten and then come those things unfit for\nears polite, as you truly term them; they will be racked and have\ntheir eyes burned out, as you were saying. And you may suppose that\nI have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors. But will you\nlet me assume, without reciting them, that these things are true?\n\nCertainly, he said, what you say is true. \nThese, then, are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed\nupon the just by gods and men in this present life, in addition to\nthe other good things which justice of herself provides.\n\nYes, he said; and they are fair and lasting. \nAnd yet, I said, all these are as nothing, either in number or greatness\nin comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and\nunjust after death. And you ought to hear them, and then both just\nand unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which\nthe argument owes to them. \n\nSpeak, he said; there are few things which I would more gladly hear.\n\nSocrates \n\nWell, I said, I will tell you a tale; not one of the tales which Odysseus\ntells to the hero Alcinous, yet this too is a tale of a hero, Er the\nson of Armenius, a Pamphylian by birth. He was slain in battle, and\nten days afterwards, when the bodies of the dead were taken up already\nin a state of corruption, his body was found unaffected by decay,\nand carried away home to be buried. And on the twelfth day, as he\nwas lying on the funeral pile, he returned to life and told them what\nhe had seen in the other world. He said that when his soul left the\nbody he went on a journey with a great company, and that they came\nto a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth;\nthey were near together, and over against them were two other openings\nin the heaven above. In the intermediate space there were judges seated,\nwho commanded the just, after they had given judgment on them and\nhad bound their sentences in front of them, to ascend by the heavenly\nway on the right hand; and in like manner the unjust were bidden by\nthem to descend by the lower way on the left hand; these also bore\nthe symbols of their deeds, but fastened on their backs. He drew near,\nand they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry\nthe report of the other world to men, and they bade him hear and see\nall that was to be heard and seen in that place. Then he beheld and\nsaw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and\nearth when sentence had been given on them; and at the two other openings\nother souls, some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel,\nsome descending out of heaven clean and bright. And arriving ever\nand anon they seemed to have come from a long journey, and they went\nforth with gladness into the meadow, where they encamped as at a festival;\nand those who knew one another embraced and conversed, the souls which\ncame from earth curiously enquiring about the things above, and the\nsouls which came from heaven about the things beneath. And they told\none another of what had happened by the way, those from below weeping\nand sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured\nand seen in their journey beneath the earth (now the journey lasted\na thousand years), while those from above were describing heavenly\ndelights and visions of inconceivable beauty. The Story, Glaucon,\nwould take too long to tell; but the sum was this: --He said that\nfor every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold;\nor once in a hundred years --such being reckoned to be the length\nof man's life, and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand\nyears. If, for example, there were any who had been the cause of many\ndeaths, or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies, or been guilty\nof any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences they\nreceived punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence\nand justice and holiness were in the same proportion. I need hardly\nrepeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon\nas they were born. Of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of\nmurderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he\ndescribed. He mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits\nasked another, 'Where is Ardiaeus the Great?' (Now this Ardiaeus lived\na thousand years before the time of Er: he had been the tyrant of\nsome city of Pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder\nbrother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)\nThe answer of the other spirit was: 'He comes not hither and will\nnever come. And this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful sights which\nwe ourselves witnessed. We were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having\ncompleted all our experiences, were about to reascend, when of a sudden\nArdiaeus appeared and several others, most of whom were tyrants; and\nthere were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been\ngreat criminals: they were just, as they fancied, about to return\ninto the upper world, but the mouth, instead of admitting them, gave\na roar, whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had\nnot been sufficiently punished tried to ascend; and then wild men\nof fiery aspect, who were standing by and heard the sound, seized\nand carried them off; and Ardiaeus and others they bound head and\nfoot and hand, and threw them down and flayed them with scourges,\nand dragged them along the road at the side, carding them on thorns\nlike wool, and declaring to the passers-by what were their crimes,\nand that they were being taken away to be cast into hell.' And of\nall the many terrors which they had endured, he said that there was\nnone like the terror which each of them felt at that moment, lest\nthey should hear the voice; and when there was silence, one by one\nthey ascended with exceeding joy. These, said Er, were the penalties\nand retributions, and there were blessings as great. \n\nNow when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days,\non the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and,\non the fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they\ncould see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending\nright through the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling\nthe rainbow, only brighter and purer; another day's journey brought\nthem to the place, and there, in the midst of the light, they saw\nthe ends of the chains of heaven let down from above: for this light\nis the belt of heaven, and holds together the circle of the universe,\nlike the under-girders of a trireme. From these ends is extended the\nspindle of Necessity, on which all the revolutions turn. The shaft\nand hook of this spindle are made of steel, and the whorl is made\npartly of steel and also partly of other materials. Now the whorl\nis in form like the whorl used on earth; and the description of it\nimplied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped\nout, and into this is fitted another lesser one, and another, and\nanother, and four others, making eight in all, like vessels which\nfit into one another; the whorls show their edges on the upper side,\nand on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl. This\nis pierced by the spindle, which is driven home through the centre\nof the eighth. The first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest,\nand the seven inner whorls are narrower, in the following proportions\n--the sixth is next to the first in size, the fourth next to the sixth;\nthen comes the eighth; the seventh is fifth, the fifth is sixth, the\nthird is seventh, last and eighth comes the second. The largest (of\nfixed stars) is spangled, and the seventh (or sun) is brightest; the\neighth (or moon) coloured by the reflected light of the seventh; the\nsecond and fifth (Saturn and Mercury) are in colour like one another,\nand yellower than the preceding; the third (Venus) has the whitest\nlight; the fourth (Mars) is reddish; the sixth (Jupiter) is in whiteness\nsecond. Now the whole spindle has the same motion; but, as the whole\nrevolves in one direction, the seven inner circles move slowly in\nthe other, and of these the swiftest is the eighth; next in swiftness\nare the seventh, sixth, and fifth, which move together; third in swiftness\nappeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the\nfourth; the third appeared fourth and the second fifth. The spindle\nturns on the knees of Necessity; and on the upper surface of each\ncircle is a siren, who goes round with them, hymning a single tone\nor note. The eight together form one harmony; and round about, at\nequal intervals, there is another band, three in number, each sitting\nupon her throne: these are the Fates, daughters of Necessity, who\nare clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads, Lachesis\nand Clotho and Atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony\nof the sirens --Lachesis singing of the past, Clotho of the present,\nAtropos of the future; Clotho from time to time assisting with a touch\nof her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl\nor spindle, and Atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the\ninner ones, and Lachesis laying hold of either in turn, first with\none hand and then with the other. \n\nWhen Er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to Lachesis;\nbut first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order;\nthen he took from the knees of Lachesis lots and samples of lives,\nand having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'Hear the word\nof Lachesis, the daughter of Necessity. Mortal souls, behold a new\ncycle of life and mortality. Your genius will not be allotted to you,\nbut you choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot have\nthe first choice, and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny.\nVirtue is free, and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have\nmore or less of her; the responsibility is with the chooser --God\nis justified.' When the Interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots\nindifferently among them all, and each of them took up the lot which\nfell near him, all but Er himself (he was not allowed), and each as\nhe took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained. Then the\nInterpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives;\nand there were many more lives than the souls present, and they were\nof all sorts. There were lives of every animal and of man in every\ncondition. And there were tyrannies among them, some lasting out the\ntyrant's life, others which broke off in the middle and came to an\nend in poverty and exile and beggary; and there were lives of famous\nmen, some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for\ntheir strength and success in games, or, again, for their birth and\nthe qualities of their ancestors; and some who were the reverse of\nfamous for the opposite qualities. And of women likewise; there was\nnot, however, any definite character them, because the soul, when\nchoosing a new life, must of necessity become different. But there\nwas every other quality, and the all mingled with one another, and\nalso with elements of wealth and poverty, and disease and health;\nand there were mean states also. And here, my dear Glaucon, is the\nsupreme peril of our human state; and therefore the utmost care should\nbe taken. Let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and\nseek and follow one thing only, if peradventure he may be able to\nlearn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern\nbetween good and evil, and so to choose always and everywhere the\nbetter life as he has opportunity. He should consider the bearing\nof all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively\nupon virtue; he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined\nwith poverty or wealth in a particular soul, and what are the good\nand evil consequences of noble and humble birth, of private and public\nstation, of strength and weakness, of cleverness and dullness, and\nof all the soul, and the operation of them when conjoined; he will\nthen look at the nature of the soul, and from the consideration of\nall these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better\nand which is the worse; and so he will choose, giving the name of\nevil to the life which will make his soul more unjust, and good to\nthe life which will make his soul more just; all else he will disregard.\nFor we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life\nand after death. A man must take with him into the world below an\nadamantine faith in truth and right, that there too he may be undazzled\nby the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil, lest, coming\nupon tyrannies and similar villainies, he do irremediable wrongs to\nothers and suffer yet worse himself; but let him know how to choose\nthe mean and avoid the extremes on either side, as far as possible,\nnot only in this life but in all that which is to come. For this is\nthe way of happiness. \n\nAnd according to the report of the messenger from the other world\nthis was what the prophet said at the time: 'Even for the last comer,\nif he chooses wisely and will live diligently, there is appointed\na happy and not undesirable existence. Let not him who chooses first\nbe careless, and let not the last despair.' And when he had spoken,\nhe who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the\ngreatest tyranny; his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality,\nhe had not thought out the whole matter before he chose, and did not\nat first sight perceive that he was fated, among other evils, to devour\nhis own children. But when he had time to reflect, and saw what was\nin the lot, he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice,\nforgetting the proclamation of the prophet; for, instead of throwing\nthe blame of his misfortune on himself, he accused chance and the\ngods, and everything rather than himself. Now he was one of those\nwho came from heaven, and in a former life had dwelt in a well-ordered\nState, but his virtue was a matter of habit only, and he had no philosophy.\nAnd it was true of others who were similarly overtaken, that the greater\nnumber of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been\nschooled by trial, whereas the pilgrims who came from earth, having\nthemselves suffered and seen others suffer, were not in a hurry to\nchoose. And owing to this inexperience of theirs, and also because\nthe lot was a chance, many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for\nan evil or an evil for a good. For if a man had always on his arrival\nin this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy,\nand had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot, he might,\nas the messenger reported, be happy here, and also his journey to\nanother life and return to this, instead of being rough and underground,\nwould be smooth and heavenly. Most curious, he said, was the spectacle\n--sad and laughable and strange; for the choice of the souls was in\nmost cases based on their experience of a previous life. There he\nsaw the soul which had once been Orpheus choosing the life of a swan\nout of enmity to the race of women, hating to be born of a woman because\nthey had been his murderers; he beheld also the soul of Thamyras choosing\nthe life of a nightingale; birds, on the other hand, like the swan\nand other musicians, wanting to be men. The soul which obtained the\ntwentieth lot chose the life of a lion, and this was the soul of Ajax\nthe son of Telamon, who would not be a man, remembering the injustice\nwhich was done him the judgment about the arms. The next was Agamemnon,\nwho took the life of an eagle, because, like Ajax, he hated human\nnature by reason of his sufferings. About the middle came the lot\nof Atalanta; she, seeing the great fame of an athlete, was unable\nto resist the temptation: and after her there followed the soul of\nEpeus the son of Panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning\nin the arts; and far away among the last who chose, the soul of the\njester Thersites was putting on the form of a monkey. There came also\nthe soul of Odysseus having yet to make a choice, and his lot happened\nto be the last of them all. Now the recollection of former tolls had\ndisenchanted him of ambition, and he went about for a considerable\ntime in search of the life of a private man who had no cares; he had\nsome difficulty in finding this, which was lying about and had been\nneglected by everybody else; and when he saw it, he said that he would\nhave done the had his lot been first instead of last, and that he\nwas delighted to have it. And not only did men pass into animals,\nbut I must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who\nchanged into one another and into corresponding human natures --the\ngood into the gentle and the evil into the savage, in all sorts of\ncombinations. \n\nAll the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the order\nof their choice to Lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they\nhad severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller\nof the choice: this genius led the souls first to Clotho, and drew\nthem within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus\nratifying the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to\nthis, carried them to Atropos, who spun the threads and made them\nirreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the\nthrone of Necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on\nin a scorching heat to the plain of Forgetfulness, which was a barren\nwaste destitute of trees and verdure; and then towards evening they\nencamped by the river of Unmindfulness, whose water no vessel can\nhold; of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity, and\nthose who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary;\nand each one as he drank forgot all things. Now after they had gone\nto rest, about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and\nearthquake, and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all\nmanner of ways to their birth, like stars shooting. He himself was\nhindered from drinking the water. But in what manner or by what means\nhe returned to the body he could not say; only, in the morning, awaking\nsuddenly, he found himself lying on the pyre. \n\nAnd thus, Glaucon, the tale has been saved and has not perished, and\nwill save us if we are obedient to the word spoken; and we shall pass\nsafely over the river of Forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled.\nWherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way\nand follow after justice and virtue always, considering that the soul\nis immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of\nevil. Thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods, both\nwhile remaining here and when, like conquerors in the games who go\nround to gather gifts, we receive our reward. And it shall be well\nwith us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years\nwhich we have been describing. \n\nTHE END\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCopyright statement:\nThe Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C.
